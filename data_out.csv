0,Deep Phenotypic Cell Classification using Capsule Neural Network,"Recent developments in ultra-high-throughput microscopy have created a new generation of cell classification methodologies focused solely on image-based cell phenotypes. These image-based analyses enable morphological profiling and screening of thousands or even millions of single cells at a fraction of the cost. They have been shown to demonstrate the statistical significance required for understanding the role of cell heterogeneity in diverse biologists. However, these single-cell analysis techniques are slow and require expensive genetic/epigenetic analysis. This treatise proposes an innovative DL system based on the newly created capsule networks (CapsNet) architecture. The proposed deep CapsNet model employs ""Capsules"" for high-level feature abstraction relevant to the cell category. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed system can accurately classify different types of cells based on phenotypic label-free bright-field images with over 98.06% accuracy and that deep CapsNet models outperform CNN models in the prior art.",NO_AFFILIATIONS,"Subhankar Chattoraj, Arnab Chakraborty, Akash Gupta, Yash Vishwakarma, Karan Vishwakarma, Jeetashree Aparajeeta, ",Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society.

1,Mask Dynamic Routing to Combined Model of Deep Capsule Network and U-Net,"The capsule network is a novel architecture to encode feature attributes and spatial relationships of an image. By using the dynamic routing (DR) algorithm, a capsule network (CapsNet) model can be trained. However, the original three-layer CapsNet with the DR algorithm performs poorly on complex data sets, such as FashionMNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100. This deficiency limits the wider application of capsule networks. In this article, we propose a deep capsule network model combined with a U-Net preprocessing module (DCN-UN). Local connection and weight-sharing strategies are adopted from convolutional neural networks to design a convolutional capsule layer in the DCN-UN model. This allows considerably reducing the number of parameters in the network model. Moreover, a greedy strategy is incorporated into the design of a mask DR (MDR) algorithm to improve the performance of network models. DCN-UN requires up to five times fewer parameters compared with the original CapsNet and other CapsNet-based models. The performance improvement achieved by the DCN-UN model with the MDR algorithm over the original CapsNet model with the DR algorithm is approximately 12% and 17% on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 data sets, respectively. The experimental results confirm that the proposed DCN-UN model allows preserving advantages of image reconstruction and equivariance mechanism in capsule networks. Moreover, an efficient initialization method is explored to enhance training stability and avoid gradient explosion.",NO_AFFILIATIONS,"Junying Chen, Zhan Liu, ",IEEE transactions on neural networks and learning systems,NO_DATE,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32310796
2,Topographic Variations in Retinal Encoding of Visual Space,"A retina completely devoid of topographic variations would be homogenous, encoding any given feature uniformly across the visual field. In a naive view, such homogeneity would appear advantageous. However, it is now clear that retinal topographic variations exist across mammalian species in a variety of forms and patterns. We briefly review some of the more established topographic variations in retinas of different mammalian species and focus on the recent discovery that cells belonging to a single neuronal subtype may exhibit distinct topographic variations in distribution, morphology, and even function. We concentrate on the mouse retina-originally viewed as homogenous-in which genetic labeling of distinct neuronal subtypes and other advanced techniques have revealed unexpected anatomical and physiological topographic variations. Notably, different subtypes reveal different patterns of nonuniformity, which may even be opposite or orthogonal to one another. These topographic variations in the encoding of visual space should be considered when studying visual processing in the retina and beyond.","['1 Department of Neurobiology, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot 7610001, Israel; email: alina.heukamp@weizmann.ac.il, rebekah.warwick@weizmann.ac.il, michal.rivlin@weizmann.ac.il.']","Alina Sophie Heukamp, Rebekah Anne Warwick, Michal Rivlin-Etzion, ",Annual review of vision science,2020,cone opsins; fovea; mouse; retina; retinal ganglion cells; topography.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32320630
3,Retinal organoid light responsivity: current status and future opportunities,"The ability to generate human retinas in vitro from pluripotent stem cells opened unprecedented opportunities for basic science and for the development of therapeutic approaches for retinal degenerative diseases. Retinal organoid models not only mimic the histoarchitecture and cellular composition of the native retina, but they can achieve a remarkable level of maturation that allows them to respond to light stimulation. However, studies evaluating the nature, magnitude, and properties of light-evoked responsivity from each cell type, in each retinal organoid layer, have been sparse. In this review we discuss the current understanding of retinal organoid function, the technologies used for functional assessment in human retinal organoids, and the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead.","['1 Department of Biology, The University of Akron, Akron, Ohio.', '2 CellSight Ocular Stem Cell and Regeneration Program, Sue Anschutz-Rodgers Eye Center, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, Colorado.

4,Understanding the retinal basis of vision across species,"The vertebrate retina first evolved some 500 million years ago in ancestral marine chordates. Since then, the eyes of different species have been tuned to best support their unique visuoecological lifestyles. Visual specializations in eye designs, large-scale inhomogeneities across the retinal surface and local circuit motifs mean that all species' retinas are unique. Computational theories, such as the efficient coding hypothesis, have come a long way towards an explanation of the basic features of retinal organization and function; however, they cannot explain the full extent of retinal diversity within and across species. To build a truly general understanding of vertebrate vision and the retina's computational purpose, it is therefore important to more quantitatively relate different species' retinal functions to their specific natural environments and behavioural requirements. Ultimately, the goal of such efforts should be to build up to a more general theory of vision.","['1 Sussex Neuroscience, School of Life Sciences, University of Sussex, Brighton, UK. t.baden@sussex.ac.uk.', '2 Institute for Ophthalmic Research, University of Tübingen, Tübingen, Germany. t.baden@sussex.ac.uk.', '3 Institute for Ophthalmic Research, University of Tübingen, Tübingen, Germany.', '4 Werner Reichardt Centre for Integrative Neuroscience, University of Tübingen, Tübingen, Germany.', '5 Institute for Bioinformatics and Medical Informatics, University of Tübingen, Tübingen, Germany.', '6 Bernstein Centre for Computational Neuroscience, University of Tübingen, Tübingen, Germany.']","Tom Baden, Thomas Euler, Philipp Berens, ",Nature reviews.

5,CapsProm: a capsule network for promoter prediction,"Locating the promoter region in DNA sequences is of paramount importance in bioinformatics. This problem has been widely studied in the literature, but it has not yet been fully resolved. Some researchers have shown remarkable results using convolutional networks that allowed the automatic extraction of features from a DNA chain. However, a single architecture schema that could learn the promoter prediction task competitively for several organisms has not yet been achieved. Thus, researchers must seek new architectures by hand-designing or by Neural Architecture Search for each new evaluated organism dataset. This work proposes a versatile architecture based on a capsule network that can accurately identify promoter sequences in raw DNA data from five different organisms, eukaryotic and prokaryotic. Our architecture, the CapsProm, could help create models with minimum effort to learn the promoter identification task between different datasets. Furthermore, the CapsProm showed competitive results, overcoming the baseline method in five out of seven tested datasets (F1-score).

6,Physiology and evolution of oxygen secreting mechanism in the fisheye,"Most teleost fishes possess a unique system for tissue oxygen supply, where oxygen is delivered to the retina at partial pressures that exceed one atmosphere, providing a steep gradient for oxygen diffusion through their thick avascular retinas. This exceptional physiological system works through the elaborate interplay between highly pH-sensitive hemoglobins, acid-producing metabolic pathways, and a retinal vasculature with specialized structural and functional properties. This graphical review summarizes recent advances in understanding the mechanisms underlying retinal oxygen secretion and their impact on visual processing. Further, it discusses how the evolution of this complex physiological system provided the essential physiological exaptations for the adaptive improvements of vision in early teleost evolution. Finally, it summarizes knowledge gaps and directions for future research on this unique system for tissue oxygen supply.","['1 Aarhus Institute of Advanced Studies, Aarhus University, Aarhus C, Denmark; Section for Zoophysiology, Department of Biology, Aarhus University, Aarhus C, Denmark.

7,The Role of Hsp90 in Retinal Proteostasis and Disease,"Photoreceptors are sensitive neuronal cells with great metabolic demands, as they are responsible for carrying out visual phototransduction, a complex and multistep process that requires the exquisite coordination of a large number of signalling protein components. Therefore, the viability of photoreceptors relies on mechanisms that ensure a well-balanced and functional proteome that maintains the protein homeostasis, or proteostasis, of the cell. This review explores how the different isoforms of Hsp90, including the cytosolic Hsp90α/β, the mitochondrial TRAP1, and the ER-specific GRP94, are involved in the different proteostatic mechanisms of photoreceptors, and elaborates on Hsp90 function when retinal homeostasis is disturbed. In addition, several studies have shown that chemical manipulation of Hsp90 has significant consequences, both in healthy and degenerating retinae, and this can be partially attributed to the fact that Hsp90 interacts with important photoreceptor-associated client proteins. Here, the interaction of Hsp90 with the retina-specific client proteins PDE6 and GRK1 will be further discussed, providing additional insights for the role of Hsp90 in retinal disease.","['1 UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, 11-43 Bath Street, London EC1V 9EL, UK.']","Kalliopi Ziaka, Jacqueline van der Spuy, ",Biomolecules,2022,Hsp90; chaperone; co-chaperone; heat shock protein; inherited retinal disease; photoreceptor; phototransduction; proteostasis.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35883534
8,CapsNet-LDA: predicting lncRNA-disease associations using attention mechanism and capsule network based on multi-view data,"Cumulative studies have shown that many long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are crucial in a number of diseases. Predicting potential lncRNA-disease associations (LDAs) can facilitate disease prevention, diagnosis and treatment. Therefore, it is vital to develop practical computational methods for LDA prediction. In this study, we propose a novel predictor named capsule network (CapsNet)-LDA for LDA prediction. CapsNet-LDA first uses a stacked autoencoder for acquiring the informative low-dimensional representations of the lncRNA-disease pairs under multiple views, then the attention mechanism is leveraged to implement an adaptive allocation of importance weights to them, and they are subsequently processed using a CapsNet-based architecture for predicting LDAs. Different from the conventional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that have some restrictions with the usage of scalar neurons and pooling operations. the CapsNets use vector neurons instead of scalar neurons that have better robustness for the complex combination of features and they use dynamic routing processes for updating parameters. CapsNet-LDA is superior to other five state-of-the-art models on four benchmark datasets, four perturbed datasets and an independent test set in the comparison experiments, demonstrating that CapsNet-LDA has excellent performance and robustness against perturbation, as well as good generalization ability. The ablation studies verify the effectiveness of some modules of CapsNet-LDA. Moreover, the ability of multi-view data to improve performance is proven. Case studies further indicate that CapsNet-LDA can accurately predict novel LDAs for specific diseases.","['1 College of Computer and Information Engineering, Jiangxi Agricultural University, Nanchang, 310045 Jiangxi, China.', '2 College of Information Science and Engineering, Hunan University, Changsha 410082, Hunan, China.']","Zequn Zhang, Junlin Xu, Yanan Wu, Niannian Liu, Yinglong Wang, Ying Liang, ",Briefings in bioinformatics,2023,attention mechanism; capsule network; lncRNA-disease association prediction; multi-view; stacked autoencoder.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36511221
9,CapsNet-COVID19: Lung CT image classification method based on CapsNet model,"The outbreak of the Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has posed a serious threat to human health and life around the world. As the number of COVID-19 cases continues to increase, many countries are facing problems such as errors in nucleic acid testing (RT-PCR), shortage of testing reagents, and lack of testing personnel. In order to solve such problems, it is necessary to propose a more accurate and efficient method as a supplement to the detection and diagnosis of COVID-19. This research uses a deep network model to classify some of the COVID-19, general pneumonia, and normal lung CT images in the 2019 Novel Coronavirus Information Database. The first level of the model uses convolutional neural networks to locate lung regions in lung CT images. The second level of the model uses the capsule network to classify and predict the segmented images. The accuracy of our method is 84.291% on the test set and 100% on the training set. Experiment shows that our classification method is suitable for medical image classification with complex background, low recognition rate, blurred boundaries and large image noise. We believe that this classification method is of great value for monitoring and controlling the growth of patients in COVID-19 infected areas.","['1 Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Taizhou Technology Institute, Taizhou 225300, China.', '2 Donghua University, College of Information Science and Technology, Shanghai 201620, China.']","XiaoQing Zhang, GuangYu Wang, Shu-Guang Zhao, ",Mathematical biosciences and engineering : MBE,2022,COVID-19; CT image analysis of lungs; capsule network; convolutional neural network; medical image classification; medical image segmentation.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35430853
10,Dilated convolution capsule network for apple leaf disease identification,"Accurate and rapid identification of apple leaf diseases is the basis for preventing and treating apple diseases. However, it is challenging to identify apple leaf diseases due to their various symptoms, different colors, irregular shapes, uneven sizes, and complex backgrounds. To reduce computational cost and improve training results, a dilated convolution capsule network (DCCapsNet) is constructed for apple leaf disease identification based on a capsule network (CapsNet) and two dilated Inception modules with different dilation rates. The network can obtain multi-scale deep-level features to improve the classification capability of the model. The dynamic routing algorithm is used between the front and back layers of CapsNet to make the model converge quickly. In DCCapsNet, dilated Inception instead of traditional convolution is used to increase the convolution receptive fields and extract multi-scale features from disease leaf images, and CapsNet is used to capture the classification features of changeable disease leaves and overcome the overfitting problem in the training network. Extensive experiment results on the apple disease leaf image dataset demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively identify apple diseases. The method can realize the rapid and accurate identification of apple leaf disease.","[""1 School of Electronic Information, Xijing University, Xi'an, China.""]","Cong Xu, Xuqi Wang, Shanwen Zhang, ",Frontiers in plant science,2022,apple leaf disease identification; capsule network (CapsNet); dilated convolution; dilated convolution CapsNet (DCCapsNet); inception.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36388492
11,Diabetic photoreceptors: Mechanisms underlying changes in structure and function,"Based on clinical findings, diabetic retinopathy (DR) has traditionally been defined as a retinal microvasculopathy. Retinal neuronal dysfunction is now recognized as an early event in the diabetic retina before development of overt DR. While detrimental effects of diabetes on the survival and function of inner retinal cells, such as retinal ganglion cells and amacrine cells, are widely recognized, evidence that photoreceptors in the outer retina undergo early alterations in diabetes has emerged more recently. We review data from preclinical and clinical studies demonstrating a conserved reduction of electrophysiological function in diabetic retinas, as well as evidence for photoreceptor loss. Complementing in vivo studies, we discuss the ex vivo electroretinography technique as a useful method to investigate photoreceptor function in isolated retinas from diabetic animal models. Finally, we consider the possibility that early photoreceptor pathology contributes to the progression of DR, and discuss possible mechanisms of photoreceptor damage in the diabetic retina, such as enhanced production of reactive oxygen species and other inflammatory factors whose detrimental effects may be augmented by phototransduction.","['1 John A.

12,Deep Q-CapsNet Reinforcement Learning Framework for Intrauterine Cavity Segmentation in TTTS Fetal Surgery Planning,"Fetoscopic laser photocoagulation is the most effective treatment for Twin-to-Twin Transfusion Syndrome, a condition affecting twin pregnancies in which there is a deregulation of blood circulation through the placenta, that can be fatal to both babies. For the purposes of surgical planning, we design the first automatic approach to detect and segment the intrauterine cavity from axial, sagittal and coronal MRI stacks. Our methodology relies on the ability of capsule networks to successfully capture the part-whole interdependency of objects in the scene, particularly for unique class instances (i.e., intrauterine cavity). The presented deep Q-CapsNet reinforcement learning framework is built upon a context-adaptive detection policy to generate a bounding box of the womb. A capsule architecture is subsequently designed to segment (or refine) the whole intrauterine cavity. This network is coupled with a strided nnU-Net feature extractor, which encodes discriminative feature maps to construct strong primary capsules. The method is robustly evaluated with and without the localization stage using 13 performance measures, and directly compared with 15 state-of-the-art deep neural networks trained on 71 singleton and monochorionic twin pregnancies.

13,A novel CapsNet neural network based on MobileNetV2 structure for robot image classification,"Image classification indicates that it classifies the images into a certain category according to the information in the image. Therefore, extracting image feature information is an important research content in image classification. Traditional image classification mainly uses machine learning methods to extract features. With the continuous development of deep learning, various deep learning algorithms are gradually applied to image classification. However, traditional deep learning-based image classification methods have low classification efficiency and long convergence time. The training networks are prone to over-fitting. In this paper, we present a novel CapsNet neural network based on the MobileNetV2 structure for robot image classification. Aiming at the problem that the lightweight network will sacrifice classification accuracy, the MobileNetV2 is taken as the base network architecture. CapsNet is improved by optimizing the dynamic routing algorithm to generate the feature graph. The attention module is introduced to increase the weight of the saliency feature graph learned by the convolutional layer to improve its classification accuracy. The parallel input of spatial information and channel information reduces the computation and complexity of network. Finally, the experiments are carried out in CIFAR-100 dataset. The results show that the proposed model is superior to other robot image classification models in terms of classification accuracy and robustness.","['1 Faculty of Robot Science and Engineering, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China.']","Jingsi Zhang, Xiaosheng Yu, Xiaoliang Lei, Chengdong Wu, ",Frontiers in neurorobotics,2022,CapsNet neural network; MobileNetV2; attention module; robot image classification; spatial and channel information.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36247359
14,RescueSNN: enabling reliable executions on spiking neural network accelerators under permanent faults,"To maximize the performance and energy efficiency of Spiking Neural Network (SNN) processing on resource-constrained embedded systems, specialized hardware accelerators/chips are employed. However, these SNN chips may suffer from permanent faults which can affect the functionality of weight memory and neuron behavior, thereby causing potentially significant accuracy degradation and system malfunctioning. Such permanent faults may come from manufacturing defects during the fabrication process, and/or from device/transistor damages (e.g., due to wear out) during the run-time operation. However, the impact of permanent faults in SNN chips and the respective mitigation techniques have not been thoroughly investigated yet. Toward this, we propose RescueSNN, a novel methodology to mitigate permanent faults in the compute engine of SNN chips without requiring additional retraining, thereby significantly cutting down the design time and retraining costs, while maintaining the throughput and quality. The key ideas of our RescueSNN methodology are (1) analyzing the characteristics of SNN under permanent faults; (2) leveraging this analysis to improve the SNN fault-tolerance through effective fault-aware mapping (FAM); and (3) devising lightweight hardware enhancements to support FAM. Our FAM technique leverages the fault map of SNN compute engine for (i) minimizing weight corruption when mapping weight bits on the faulty memory cells, and (ii) selectively employing faulty neurons that do not cause significant accuracy degradation to maintain accuracy and throughput, while considering the SNN operations and processing dataflow. The experimental results show that our RescueSNN improves accuracy by up to 80% while maintaining the throughput reduction below 25% in high fault rate (e.g., 0.5 of the potential fault locations), as compared to running SNNs on the faulty chip without mitigation. In this manner, the embedded systems that employ RescueSNN-enhanced chips can efficiently ensure reliable executions against permanent faults during their operational lifetime.","['1 Embedded Computing Systems, Institute of Computer Engineering, Technische Universität Wien (TU Wien), Vienna, Austria.', '2 eBrain Lab, Division of Engineering, New York University Abu Dhabi (NYUAD), Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.']","Rachmad Vidya Wicaksana Putra, Muhammad Abdullah Hanif, Muhammad Shafique, ",Frontiers in neuroscience,2023,accelerators; fault tolerance; manufacturing defects; permanent faults; reliability; resilience; spiking neural networks.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37123371

      The aim of the study is to improve the accuracy of age related macular degeneration (AMD) disease in its earlier phases with proposed Capsule Network (CapsNet) architecture trained on speckle noise reduced spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) images based on an optimized Bayesian non-local mean (OBNLM) filter augmentation techniques. Methods:
        
      
      A total of 726 local SD-OCT images were collected and labelled as 159 drusen, 145 dry AMD, 156 wet AMD and 266 normal. Region of interest (ROI) was identified. Speckle noise in SD-OCT images were reduced based on OBNLM filter. The processed images were fed to proposed CapsNet architecture to clasify SD-OCT images. Accuracy rates were calculated in both public and local dataset. Results:
        
      
      Accuracy rate of local SD-OCT image dataset classification was achieved to a value of 96.39% after performing data augmentation and speckle noise reduction with OBNLM. The performance of proposed CapsNet was also evaluated on the public Kaggle dataset under the same processing procedures and the accuracy rate was calculated as 98.07%. The sensitivity and specificity rates were 96.72% and 99.98%, respectively. Conclusions:
        
      
      The classification success of proposed CapsNet may be improved with robust pre-processing steps like; determination of ROI and denoised SD-OCT images based on OBNLM.

16,Prediction of Peptide Detectability Based on CapsNet and Convolutional Block Attention Module,"According to proteomics technology, as impacted by the complexity of sampling in the experimental process, several problems remain with the reproducibility of mass spectrometry experiments, and the peptide identification and quantitative results continue to be random. Predicting the detectability exhibited by peptides can optimize the mentioned results to be more accurate, so such a prediction is of high research significance. This study builds a novel method to predict the detectability of peptides by complying with the capsule network (CapsNet) and the convolutional block attention module (CBAM). First, the residue conical coordinate (RCC), the amino acid composition (AAC), the dipeptide composition (DPC), and the sequence embedding code (SEC) are extracted as the peptide chain features. Subsequently, these features are divided into the biological feature and sequence feature, and separately inputted into the neural network of CapsNet. Moreover, the attention module CBAM is added to the network to assign weights to channels and spaces, as an attempt to enhance the feature learning and improve the network training effect. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, it is compared with some other popular methods. As revealed from the experimentally achieved results, the proposed method outperforms those methods in most performance assessments.","['1 Department of Mathematical Sciences, School of Science, Zhejiang Sci-Tech University, Xuelin St., Hangzhou 310018, China.', '2 Institutes of Biomedical Sciences, Fudan University, 138 Yixueyuan Road, Shanghai 200032, China.']","Minzhe Yu, Yushuai Duan, Zhong Li, Yang Zhang, ",International journal of molecular sciences,2021,CBAM; CapsNet; amino acid composition; dipeptide composition; peptide detectability; physicochemical properties of residues.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34769509
17,Part-Object Relational Visual Saliency,"Recent years have witnessed a big leap in automatic visual saliency detection attributed to advances in deep learning, especially Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). However, inferring the saliency of each image part separately, as was adopted by most CNNs methods, inevitably leads to an incomplete segmentation of the salient object. In this paper, we describe how to use the property of part-object relations endowed by the Capsule Network (CapsNet) to solve the problems that fundamentally hinge on relational inference for visual saliency detection. Concretely, we put in place a two-stream strategy, termed Two-Stream Part-Object RelaTional Network (TSPORTNet), to implement CapsNet, aiming to reduce both the network complexity and the possible redundancy during capsule routing. Additionally, taking into account the correlations of capsule types from the preceding training images, a correlation-aware capsule routing algorithm is developed for more accurate capsule assignments at the training stage, which also speeds up the training dramatically. By exploring part-object relationships, TSPORTNet produces a capsule wholeness map, which in turn aids multi-level features in generating the final saliency map. Experimental results on five widely-used benchmarks show that our framework consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance.

18,Accurate Reconstruction of Image Stimuli From Human Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Based on the Decoding Model With Capsule Network Architecture,"In neuroscience, all kinds of computation models were designed to answer the open question of how sensory stimuli are encoded by neurons and conversely, how sensory stimuli can be decoded from neuronal activities. Especially, functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) studies have made many great achievements with the rapid development of deep network computation. However, comparing with the goal of decoding orientation, position and object category from human fMRI in visual cortex, accurate reconstruction of image stimuli is a still challenging work. Current prevailing methods were composed of two independent steps, (1) decoding intermediate features from human fMRI and (2) reconstruction using the decoded intermediate features. The new concept of 'capsule' and 'capsule' based neural network were proposed recently. The 'capsule' represented a kind of structure containing a group of neurons to perform better feature representation. Especially, the high-level capsule's features in the capsule network (CapsNet) contains various features of image stimuli such as semantic class, orientation, location, scale and so on, and these features can better represent the processed information inherited in the fMRI data collected in visual cortex. In this paper, a novel CapsNet architecture based visual reconstruction (CNAVR) computation model is developed to reconstruct image stimuli from human fMRI. The CNAVR is composed of linear encoding computation from capsule's features to fMRI data and inverse reconstruction computation. In the first part, we trained the CapsNet model to obtain the non-linear mappings from images to high-level capsule's features, and from high-level capsule's features to images again in an end-to-end manner. In the second part, we trained the non-linear mapping from fMRI data of selected voxels to high-level capsule's features. For a new image stimulus, we can use the method to predict the corresponding high-level capsule's features using fMRI data, and reconstruct image stimuli with the trained reconstruction part in the CapsNet. We evaluated the proposed CNAVR method on the open dataset of handwritten digital images, and exceeded about 10% than the accuracy of all existing state-of-the-art methods on the structural similarity index (SSIM). In addition, we explained the selected voxels in specific interpretable image features to prove the effectivity and generalization of the CNAVR method.","['1 National Digital Switching System Engineering and Technological Research Center, Zhengzhou, China.']","Kai Qiao, Chi Zhang, Linyuan Wang, Jian Chen, Lei Zeng, Li Tong, Bin Yan, ",Frontiers in neuroinformatics,2018,brain decoding; capsule network (CapsNet); functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI); machine learning; visual reconstruction.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30294269
19,Efficient-CapsNet: capsule network with self-attention routing,"Deep convolutional neural networks, assisted by architectural design strategies, make extensive use of data augmentation techniques and layers with a high number of feature maps to embed object transformations. That is highly inefficient and for large datasets implies a massive redundancy of features detectors. Even though capsules networks are still in their infancy, they constitute a promising solution to extend current convolutional networks and endow artificial visual perception with a process to encode more efficiently all feature affine transformations. Indeed, a properly working capsule network should theoretically achieve higher results with a considerably lower number of parameters count due to intrinsic capability to generalize to novel viewpoints. Nevertheless, little attention has been given to this relevant aspect. In this paper, we investigate the efficiency of capsule networks and, pushing their capacity to the limits with an extreme architecture with barely 160 K parameters, we prove that the proposed architecture is still able to achieve state-of-the-art results on three different datasets with only 2% of the original CapsNet parameters. Moreover, we replace dynamic routing with a novel non-iterative, highly parallelizable routing algorithm that can easily cope with a reduced number of capsules. Extensive experimentation with other capsule implementations has proved the effectiveness of our methodology and the capability of capsule networks to efficiently embed visual representations more prone to generalization.","['1 Department of Electronics and Telecommunications, Politecnico di Torino, 10129, Turin, Italy. vittorio.mazzia@polito.it.', '2 PIC4SeR, Politecnico di Torino Interdepartmental Centre for Service Robotics, Turin, Italy. vittorio.mazzia@polito.it.', '3 SmartData@PoliTo, Big Data and Data Science Laboratory, Turin, Italy. vittorio.mazzia@polito.it.', '4 Department of Electronics and Telecommunications, Politecnico di Torino, 10129, Turin, Italy.', '5 PIC4SeR, Politecnico di Torino Interdepartmental Centre for Service Robotics, Turin, Italy.', '6 SmartData@PoliTo, Big Data and Data Science Laboratory, Turin, Italy.']","Vittorio Mazzia, Francesco Salvetti, Marcello Chiaberge, ",Scientific reports,2021,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34282164
20,"Brain Tumor Diagnosis Using Machine Learning, Convolutional Neural Networks, Capsule Neural Networks and Vision Transformers, Applied to MRI: A Survey","Management of brain tumors is based on clinical and radiological information with presumed grade dictating treatment. Hence, a non-invasive assessment of tumor grade is of paramount importance to choose the best treatment plan. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) represent one of the effective Deep Learning (DL)-based techniques that have been used for brain tumor diagnosis. However, they are unable to handle input modifications effectively. Capsule neural networks (CapsNets) are a novel type of machine learning (ML) architecture that was recently developed to address the drawbacks of CNNs. CapsNets are resistant to rotations and affine translations, which is beneficial when processing medical imaging datasets. Moreover, Vision Transformers (ViT)-based solutions have been very recently proposed to address the issue of long-range dependency in CNNs. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of brain tumor classification and segmentation techniques, with a focus on ML-based, CNN-based, CapsNet-based, and ViT-based techniques. The survey highlights the fundamental contributions of recent studies and the performance of state-of-the-art techniques. Moreover, we present an in-depth discussion of crucial issues and open challenges. We also identify some key limitations and promising future research directions. We envisage that this survey shall serve as a good springboard for further study.","['1 NOVA Information Management School (NOVA IMS), Universidade NOVA de Lisboa, Campus de Campolide, 1070-312 Lisboa, Portugal.', '2 Department of Computer Science and Informatics, University of the Free State, Phuthaditjhaba 9866, South Africa.', '3 Department of Biomedical and Neuromotor Sciences, Alma Mater Studiorum-University of Bologna, 40138 Bologna, Italy.', '4 IRCCS Istituto delle Scienze Neurologiche di Bologna, Functional and Molecular Neuroimaging Unit, 40139 Bologna, Italy.', '5 Department of Physiology, Anatomy, and Genetics, University of Oxford, Oxford OX1 3PT, UK.', '6 Department of Radiology, Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Oxford OX3 9DU, UK.', '7 Oxford Centre for Clinical Magnetic Research Imaging, University of Oxford, Oxford OX3 9DU, UK.', '8 Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham B15 2SY, UK.', '9 Department of Information and Electrical Engineering and Applied Mathematics, University of Salerno, 84084 Fisciano, Italy.']","Andronicus A Akinyelu, Fulvio Zaccagna, James T Grist, Mauro Castelli, Leonardo Rundo, ",Journal of imaging,2022,brain cancer; capsule neural networks; deep learning; machine learning; magnetic resonance imaging; vision transformers.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35893083
21,Prenatal prediction of survival in congenital diaphragmatic hernia: An audit of postnatal outcomes,"Purpose:
        
      
      Effective antenatal counseling in congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) relies on proper measurement of prognostic indices. This quality initiative audited the accuracy of prenatal imaging with postnatal outcomes at two tertiary pediatric referral centers. Methods:
        
      
      Prenatal lung-head ratio (LHR) and total fetal lung volume (TFLV) for CDH patients treated between 2006 and 2017 were retrieved. Study inclusion required at least one LHR or TFLV measurement between 24 and 32 weeks gestational age. Postnatal outcomes [mortality, extracorporeal life support (ECLS) need, patch repair, persistent pulmonary hypertension, oxygen requirement at 28 days] were abstracted from the Canadian Pediatric Surgery Network (CAPSNet) database and local chart review. Univariate and descriptive analyses were conducted. Results:
        
      
      Eighty-two of 121 eligible CDH patients (68%) were included. Overall mortality, ECLS rates, and patch repair were 33%, 12.5%, and 45%, respectively. Lower LHR values correlated with increased rates of each outcome and persisted despite multiple measurements. Values obtained were higher than those in published schemata. LHR values >45% were most associated with survival, avoidance of ECLS, and primary repair. TFLV values only correlated with mortality and patch repair. Conclusions:
        
      
      This audit confirms that LHR and TFLV values predict CDH outcomes. However, absolute values obtained require careful interpretation and internal review. Level of evidence:

22,Mathematical Assessment of Machine Learning Models Used for Brain Tumor Diagnosis,"The brain is an intrinsic and complicated component of human anatomy. It is a collection of connective tissues and nerve cells that regulate the principal actions of the entire body. Brain tumor cancer is a serious mortality factor and a highly intractable disease. Even though brain tumors are not considered a fundamental cause of cancer deaths worldwide, about 40% of other cancer types are metastasized to the brain and transform into brain tumors. Computer-aided devices for diagnosis through magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have remained the gold standard for the diagnosis of brain tumors, but this conventional method has been greatly challenged with inefficiencies and drawbacks related to the late detection of brain tumors, high risk in biopsy procedures, and low specificity. To circumvent these underlying hurdles, machine learning models have recently been developed to enhance computer-aided diagnosis tools for advanced, precise, and automatic early detection of brain tumors. This study takes a novel approach to evaluate machine learning models (support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), gradient-boosting model (GBM), convolutional neural network (CNN), K-nearest neighbor (KNN), AlexNet, GoogLeNet, CNN VGG19, and CapsNet) used for the early detection and classification of brain tumors by deploying the multicriteria decision-making method called fuzzy preference ranking organization method for enrichment evaluations (PROMETHEE), based on selected parameters, in this study: prediction accuracy, precision, specificity, recall, processing time, and sensitivity. To validate the results of our proposed approach, we performed a sensitivity analysis and cross-checking analysis with the PROMETHEE model. The CNN model, with an outranking net flow of 0.0251, is considered the most favorable model for the early detection of brain tumors. The KNN model, with a net flow of -0.0154, is the least appealing option. The findings of this study support the applicability of the proposed approach for making optimal choices regarding the selection of machine learning models. The decision maker is thus afforded the opportunity to expand the range of considerations which they must rely on in selecting the preferred models for early detection of brain tumors.","['1 Department of Medical Diagnostic Imaging, College of Health Science, University of Sharjah, Sharjah 27272, United Arab Emirates.', '2 Operational Research Centre in Healthcare, Near East University, TRNC Mersin 10, Nicosia 99138, Turkey.', '3 Department of Statistics, Carlos III University of Madrid, 28903 Madrid, Spain.', '4 Department of Mathematics, Near East University, TRNC Mersin 10, Nicosia 99138, Turkey.', '5 Brain Health Imaging Institute, Department of Radiology, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY 10065, USA.']","Dilber Uzun Ozsahin, Efe Precious Onakpojeruo, Berna Uzun, Mubarak Taiwo Mustapha, Ilker Ozsahin, ","Diagnostics (Basel, Switzerland)",2023,brain tumors diagnosis; convolutional neural networks; decision making; fuzzy PROMETHEE; machine learning; magnetic resonance imaging.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36832106

      In infants with gastroschisis, outcomes were compared between those where operative reduction and fascial closure were attempted ≤24 hours of age (PC), and those who underwent planned closure of their defect >24 hours of age following reduction with a pre-formed silo (SR). Summary of background data:
        
      
      Inadequate evidence exists to determine how best to treat infants with gastroschisis. Methods:
        
      
      A secondary analysis was conducted of data collected 2006-2008 using the British Association of Pediatric Surgeons Congenital Anomalies Surveillance System, and 2005-2016 using the Canadian Pediatric Surgery Network.28-day outcomes were compared between infants undergoing PC and SR. Primary outcome was number of gastrointestinal complications. Interactions were investigated between infant characteristics and treatment to determine whether intervention effect varied in sub-groups of infants. Results:
        
      
      Data from 341 British and Irish infants (27%) and 927 Canadian infants (73%) were used. 671 infants (42%) underwent PC and 597 (37%) underwent SR. The effect of SR on outcome varied according to the presence/absence of intestinal perforation, intestinal matting and intestinal necrosis. In infants without these features, SR was associated with fewer gastrointestinal complications [aIRR 0.25 (95% CI 0.09-0.67, P = 0.006)], more operations [aIRR 1.40 (95% CI 1.22-1.60, P < 0.001)], more days PN [aIRR 1.08 (95% CI 1.03-1.13, P < 0.001)], and a higher infection risk [aOR 2.06 (95% CI 1.10-3.87, P = 0.025)]. In infants with these features, SR was associated with a greater number of operations [aIRR 1.30 (95% CI 1.17-1.45, P < 0.001)], and more days PN [aIRR 1.06 (95% CI 1.02-1.10, P = 0.003)]. Conclusions:
        
      
      In infants without intestinal perforation, matting, or necrosis, the benefits of SR outweigh its drawbacks. In infants with these features, the opposite is true.

24,Fusion-Based Deep Learning with Nature-Inspired Algorithm for Intracerebral Haemorrhage Diagnosis,"Natural computing refers to computational processes observed in nature and human-designed computing inspired by nature. In recent times, data fusion in the healthcare sector becomes a challenging issue, and it needs to be resolved. At the same time, intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) is the injury of blood vessels on the brain cells, which is mainly liable for stroke. X-rays and computed tomography (CT) scans are widely applied for locating the haemorrhage position and size. Since manual segmentation of the CT scans by planimetry by the use of radiologists is a time-consuming process, deep learning (DL) is used to attain effective ICH diagnosis performance. This paper presents an automated intracerebral haemorrhage diagnosis using fusion-based deep learning with swarm intelligence (AICH-FDLSI) algorithm. The AICH-FDLSI model operates on four major stages namely preprocessing, image segmentation, feature extraction, and classification. To begin with, the input image is preprocessed using the median filtering (MF) technique to remove the noise present in the image. Next, the seagull optimization algorithm (SOA) with Otsu multilevel thresholding is employed for image segmentation. In addition, the fusion-based feature extraction model using the Capsule Network (CapsNet) and EfficientNet is applied to extract a useful set of features. Moreover, deer hunting optimization (DHO) algorithm is utilized for the hyperparameter optimization of the CapsNet and DenseNet models. Finally, a fuzzy support vector machine (FSVM) is applied as a classification technique to identify the different classes of ICH. A set of simulations takes place to determine the diagnostic performance of the AICH-FDLSI model using the benchmark intracranial haemorrhage data set. The experimental outcome stated that the AICH-FDLSI model has reached a proficient performance over the compared methods in a significant way.","['1 Department of Mathematics and Statistics, College of Science, Taif University, Taif 21944, Saudi Arabia.', '2 Department of Mathematics, Sohag University, Sohag 82524, Egypt.', '3 Department of Mathematics, College of Science and Arts, King Abdulaziz University, P.

25,Emotion recognition from EEG based on multi-task learning with capsule network and attention mechanism,"Deep learning (DL) technologies have recently shown great potential in emotion recognition based on electroencephalography (EEG). However, existing DL-based EEG emotion recognition methods are built on single-task learning, i.e., learning arousal, valence, and dominance individually, which may ignore the complementary information of different tasks. In addition, single-task learning involves a new round of training every time a new task appears, which is time consuming. To this end, we propose a novel method for EEG-based emotion recognition based on multi-task learning with capsule network (CapsNet) and attention mechanism. First, multi-task learning can learn multiple tasks simultaneously while exploiting commonalities and differences across tasks, it can also obtain more data from different tasks, which can improve generalization and robustness. Second, the innovative structure of the CapsNet enables it to effectively characterize the intrinsic relationship among various EEG channels. Finally, the attention mechanism can change the weight of different channels to extract important information. In the DEAP dataset, the average accuracy reached 97.25%, 97.41%, and 98.35% on arousal, valence, and dominance, respectively. In the DREAMER dataset, average accuracy reached 94.96%, 95.54%, and 95.52% on arousal, valence, and dominance, respectively. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method for EEG emotion recognition.","['1 Department of Biomedical Engineering, Hefei University of Technology, Hefei, 230009, China; Anhui Province Key Laboratory of Measuring Theory and Precision Instrument, Hefei University of Technology, Hefei, 230009, China.

27,1D-CADCapsNet: One dimensional deep capsule networks for coronary artery disease detection using ECG signals,"Purpose:
        
      
      Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of death globally. Electrocardiogram (ECG), which records the electrical activity of the heart, has been used for the diagnosis of CVD. The automated and robust detection of CVD from ECG signals plays a significant role for early and accurate clinical diagnosis. The purpose of this study is to provide automated detection of coronary artery disease (CAD) from ECG signals using capsule networks (CapsNet). Methods:
        
      
      Deep learning-based approaches have become increasingly popular in computer aided diagnosis systems. Capsule networks are one of the new promising approaches in the field of deep learning. In this study, we used 1D version of CapsNet for the automated detection of coronary artery disease (CAD) on two second (95,300) and five second-long (38,120) ECG segments. These segments are obtained from 40 normal and 7 CAD subjects. In the experimental studies, 5-fold cross validation technique is employed to evaluate performance of the model. Results:
        
      
      The proposed model, which is named as 1D-CADCapsNet, yielded a promising 5-fold diagnosis accuracy of 99.44% and 98.62% for two- and five-second ECG signal groups, respectively. We have obtained the highest performance results using 2 s ECG segment than the state-of-art studies reported in the literature. Conclusions:

29,Using methanol to preserve retinas for immunostaining,"Background:
        
      
      Experimental studies on retinal vasculature and retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) investigating the developmental and pathological conditions of the retina mainly rely on whole-mount retinal immunostaining. Methanol, an auxiliary fixed medium for retinal whole-mount preparations, has been used in some studies; however, its application in short- and long-term storage of retinas for further study has not been well described. We aimed to evaluate methanol use as a preservation treatment for further immunostaining of the retina. Methods:
        
      
      We generated oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) and optic nerve crush (ONC) mouse models and used their retinas for analysis. We pipetted cold methanol (-20°C) on the surface of the retina to help fix the tissues while promoting permeability, after which the retinas were stored in cold methanol (-20°C) for 1, 6, or 12 months before being evaluated using various optical techniques. Thereafter, retinal whole-mount immunostaining was performed to analyse retinal neovascularisation and retinal hypoxia in OIR model, and retinal ganglion cell survival rate in ONC model. Results:
        
      
      Quantitative analysis revealed no significant differences in the fixed retinas after long-term storage in terms of retinal vasculature or retinal hypoxia in the OIR model. Similarly, no significant difference was found in RGC survival rate after long-term storage in methanol. These results suggest that methanol can be used as a storage medium when preserving retinal whole-mount samples. Conclusions:
        
      
      Cold (-20°C) methanol can serve as an effective medium for long-term storage of fixed retinas, which is useful for further research.","['1 Department of Ophthalmology, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.']","Ningzhi Zhang, Wenye Cao, Xuejun He, Yiqiao Xing, Ning Yang, ",Clinical & experimental ophthalmology,NO_DATE,immunostaining; methanol; retinal ganglion cell; retinal neovascularisation.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35040242

In keeping with these findings, anatomical and functional defects have been found in the visual cortex and retina of mice bearing mutations for ASD-associated genes. Here we sought to investigate the anatomy and function of the adult retina of Engrailed 2 knockout (En2-/-) mice, a model for ASD. Our results showed that En2 is expressed in all three nuclear layers of the adult retina. When compared to age-matched En2+/+ controls, En2-/- adult retinas showed a significant decrease in the number of calbindin+ horizontal cells, and a significant increase in calbindin+ amacrine/ganglion cells. The total number of ganglion cells was not altered in the adult En2-/- retina, as shown by Brn3a+ cell counts. In addition, En2-/- adult mice showed a significant reduction of photoreceptor (rhodopsin) and bipolar cell (Pcp2, PKCα) markers. Functional defects were also present in the retina of En2 mutants, as indicated by electroretinogram recordings showing a significant reduction in both a-wave and b-wave amplitude in En2-/- mice as compared to controls. These data show for the first time that anatomical and functional defects are present in the retina of the En2 ASD mouse model.","['1 Department of Cellular, Computational, and Integrative Biology (CIBIO), University of Trento, Trento, Italy.', '2 Department of Pharmacy, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy.', '3 Center for Mind/Brain Sciences (CIMeC), University of Trento, Rovereto, Italy.', '4 Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Pisa, Italy.', '5 Center for Mind/Brain Sciences (CIMeC), University of Trento, Rovereto, Italy; CNR Neuroscience Institute, Pisa, Italy.

31,A low cost neuromorphic learning engine based on a high performance supervised SNN learning algorithm,"Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are more energy- and resource-efficient than artificial neural networks (ANNs). However, supervised SNN learning is a challenging task due to non-differentiability of spikes and computation of complex terms. Moreover, the design of SNN learning engines is not an easy task due to limited hardware resources and tight energy constraints. In this article, a novel hardware-efficient SNN back-propagation scheme that offers fast convergence is proposed. The learning scheme does not require any complex operation such as error normalization and weight-threshold balancing, and can achieve an accuracy of around 97.5% on MNIST dataset using only 158,800 synapses. The multiplier-less inference engine trained using the proposed hard sigmoid SNN training (HaSiST) scheme can operate at a frequency of 135 MHz and consumes only 1.03 slice registers per synapse, 2.8 slice look-up tables, and can infer about 0.03[Formula: see text] features in a second, equivalent to 9.44 giga synaptic operations per second (GSOPS).

32,FangTianSim: High-Level Cycle-Accurate Resistive Random-Access Memory-Based Multi-Core Spiking Neural Network Processor Simulator,"Realization of spiking neural network (SNN) hardware with high energy efficiency and high integration may provide a promising solution to data processing challenges in future internet of things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI). Recently, design of multi-core reconfigurable SNN chip based on resistive random-access memory (RRAM) is drawing great attention, owing to the unique properties of RRAM, e.g., high integration density, low power consumption, and processing-in-memory (PIM). Therefore, RRAM-based SNN chip may have further improvements in integration and energy efficiency. The design of such a chip will face the following problems: significant delay in pulse transmission due to complex logic control and inter-core communication; high risk of digital, analog, and RRAM hybrid design; and non-ideal characteristics of analog circuit and RRAM. In order to effectively bridge the gap between device, circuit, algorithm, and architecture, this paper proposes a simulation model-FangTianSim, which covers analog neuron circuit, RRAM model and multi-core architecture and its accuracy is at the clock level. This model can be used to verify the functionalities, delay, and power consumption of SNN chip. This information cannot only be used to verify the rationality of the architecture but also guide the chip design.

33,Mdm1 ablation results in retinal degeneration by specific intraflagellar transport defects of photoreceptor cells,"Mouse double minute 1 (Mdm1) might be involved in the function and structure of centrioles and age-related retinal degeneration. However, the mechanism by which Mdm1 deficiency causes retinal degeneration remains unknown. We confirmed that the Mdm1 protein is localized at the connecting cilium (CC) of photoreceptor cells in the retina. The electroretinograms of 6-week-old Mdm1-/- mice revealed decreased vision, which was eventually lost, and outer segment (OS) photoreceptor degeneration was evident on postnatal day 7, with complete loss of the outer nuclear layer (ONL) observed at 35 weeks. Mdm1-/- mouse retinas showed mislocalization of opsins in the photoreceptor cells, indicating particular intraflagellar transport (IFT) defects, and entrapment of the nuclei in the ONL by microvilli of retinal pigment epithelial cells, leading to apoptosis in the ONL. These results suggest that Mdm1 ablation causes specific IFT defects, which prevents the OS from continuously replenishing new discs, resulting in retinal degeneration.","['1 Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Yeungnam University, Daegu, 42415, Republic of Korea.', '2 Smart-aging Convergence Research Center, College of Medicine, Yeungnam University, Daegu, 42415, Republic of Korea.', '3 Department of Ophthalmology, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan, College of Medicine, Seoul, 05505, Republic of Korea.', '4 Department of Ophthalmology, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan, College of Medicine, Seoul, 05505, Republic of Korea. j.lee@amc.seoul.kr.', '5 Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Yeungnam University, Daegu, 42415, Republic of Korea. kimjr@ynu.ac.kr.', '6 Smart-aging Convergence Research Center, College of Medicine, Yeungnam University, Daegu, 42415, Republic of Korea. kimjr@ynu.ac.kr.']","Youlim Son, Soo-Jin Kim, Hwa-Young Kim, Junyeop Lee, Jae-Ryong Kim, ",Cell death & disease,2022,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36171205
34,A lightweight capsule network architecture for detection of COVID-19 from lung CT scans,"COVID-19, a novel coronavirus, has spread quickly and produced a worldwide respiratory ailment outbreak. There is a need for large-scale screening to prevent the spreading of the disease. When compared with the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test, computed tomography (CT) is far more consistent, concrete, and precise in detecting COVID-19 patients through clinical diagnosis. An architecture based on deep learning has been proposed by integrating a capsule network with different variants of convolution neural networks. DenseNet, ResNet, VGGNet, and MobileNet are utilized with CapsNet to detect COVID-19 cases using lung computed tomography scans. It has found that all the four models are providing adequate accuracy, among which the VGGCapsNet, DenseCapsNet, and MobileCapsNet models have gained the highest accuracy of 99%.

35,Deep Learning With Spiking Neurons: Opportunities and Challenges,"Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are inspired by information processing in biology, where sparse and asynchronous binary signals are communicated and processed in a massively parallel fashion. SNNs on neuromorphic hardware exhibit favorable properties such as low power consumption, fast inference, and event-driven information processing. This makes them interesting candidates for the efficient implementation of deep neural networks, the method of choice for many machine learning tasks. In this review, we address the opportunities that deep spiking networks offer and investigate in detail the challenges associated with training SNNs in a way that makes them competitive with conventional deep learning, but simultaneously allows for efficient mapping to hardware. A wide range of training methods for SNNs is presented, ranging from the conversion of conventional deep networks into SNNs, constrained training before conversion, spiking variants of backpropagation, and biologically motivated variants of STDP. The goal of our review is to define a categorization of SNN training methods, and summarize their advantages and drawbacks. We further discuss relationships between SNNs and binary networks, which are becoming popular for efficient digital hardware implementation. Neuromorphic hardware platforms have great potential to enable deep spiking networks in real-world applications. We compare the suitability of various neuromorphic systems that have been developed over the past years, and investigate potential use cases. Neuromorphic approaches and conventional machine learning should not be considered simply two solutions to the same classes of problems, instead it is possible to identify and exploit their task-specific advantages. Deep SNNs offer great opportunities to work with new types of event-based sensors, exploit temporal codes and local on-chip learning, and we have so far just scratched the surface of realizing these advantages in practical applications.","['1 Bosch Center for Artificial Intelligence, Robert Bosch GmbH, Renningen, Germany.']","Michael Pfeiffer, Thomas Pfeil, ",Frontiers in neuroscience,2018,binary networks; deep learning; event-based computing; neural networks; neuromorphic engineering; spiking neurons.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30410432
36,Suprasellar Germinomas: 2 Case Reports and Literature Review,"Background:
        
      
      Germinomas are rare malignant central nervous system tumors, a type of germ cell tumor, according to the 2016 World Health Organization Classification of Brain Tumors. Most of these tumors develop along the midline, most often from the pineal gland, followed by tumors arising in the suprasellar cisterns. Suprasellar germinomas commonly manifest with diabetes insipidus, visual impairment, and hypothalamic-pituitary failure. We present a literature review from the PubMed database and report 2 cases of suprasellar germinomas. Case description:
        
      
      Both pediatric patients presented with progressive visual loss; one did not show endocrinologic impairment, and the other presented with hypothyroidism, diabetes insipidus, and generalized edema. Magnetic resonance imaging showed expansive suprasellar masses in both cases, confirmed as germinomas at histopathologic examination. The patients were treated with the same surgical approach, although their outcomes were different because of endocrinologic and post surgical complications. Conclusions:
        
      
      Suprasellar germinomas are highly curable lesions when diagnosed early. The treatment remains controversial and should be individualized, but the association of chemotherapy and radiotherapy allows reduce adverse effects and shows great results.","['1 Department of Neurosurgery, Hospital da Cidade de Passo Fundo, Passo Fundo, Brazil; Neurology and Neurosurgery Service (SNN), Passo Fundo, Brazil; Academic League of SNN (LASNN), Passo Fundo, Brazil; Medical School, University of Passo Fundo, Passo Fundo, Brazil.', '2 Department of ENT Surgery, Hospital da Cidade de Passo Fundo, Passo Fundo, Brazil; Medical School, University of Passo Fundo, Passo Fundo, Brazil.', '3 Academic League of SNN (LASNN), Passo Fundo, Brazil; Medical School, University of Passo Fundo, Passo Fundo, Brazil.

37,ALSA: Associative Learning Based Supervised Learning Algorithm for SNN,"Spiking neural network (SNN) is considered to be the brain-like model that best conforms to the biological mechanism of the brain. Due to the non-differentiability of the spike, the training method of SNNs is still incomplete. This paper proposes a supervised learning method for SNNs based on associative learning: ALSA. The method is based on the associative learning mechanism, and its realization is similar to the animal conditioned reflex process, with strong physiological plausibility and rationality. This method uses improved spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) rules, combined with a teacher layer to induct spikes of neurons, to strengthen synaptic connections between input spike patterns and specified output neurons, and weaken synaptic connections between unrelated patterns and unrelated output neurons. Based on ALSA, this paper also completed the supervised learning classification tasks of the IRIS dataset and the MNIST dataset, and achieved 95.7 and 91.58% recognition accuracy, respectively, which fully proves that ALSA is a feasible SNNs supervised learning method. The innovation of this paper is to establish a biological plausible supervised learning method for SNNs, which is based on the STDP learning rules and the associative learning mechanism that exists widely in animal training.","['1 FutureX LAB, School of Instrument Science and Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing, China.']","Lingfei Mo, Gang Wang, Erhong Long, Mingsong Zhuo, ",Frontiers in neuroscience,2022,STDP; associative learning; long-term plasticity; spiking neural network; supervised learning.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35431777
38,Towards an effective model for lung disease classification: Using Dense Capsule Nets for early classification of lung diseases,"Machine Learning and computer vision have been the frontiers of the war against the COVID-19 Pandemic. Radiology has vastly improved the diagnosis of diseases, especially lung diseases, through the early assessment of key disease factors. Chest X-rays have thus become among the commonly used radiological tests to detect and diagnose many lung diseases. However, the discovery of lung disease through X-rays is a significantly challenging task depending on the availability of skilled radiologists. There has been a recent increase in attention to the design of Convolution Neural Networks (CNN) models for lung disease classification. A considerable amount of training dataset is required for CNN to work, but the problem is that it cannot handle translation and rotation correctly as input. The recently proposed Capsule Networks (referred to as CapsNets) are new automated learning architecture that aims to overcome the shortcomings in CNN. CapsNets are vital for rotation and complex translation. They require much less training information, which applies to the processing of data sets from medical images, including radiological images of the chest X-rays. In this research, the adoption and integration of CapsNets into the problem of chest X-ray classification have been explored. The aim is to design a deep model using CapsNet that increases the accuracy of the classification problem involved. We have used convolution blocks that take input images and generate convolution layers used as input to capsule block. There are 12 capsule layers operated, and the output of each capsule is used as an input to the next convolution block. The process is repeated for all blocks. The experimental results show that the proposed architecture yields better results when compared with the existing CNN techniques by achieving a better area under the curve (AUC) average. Furthermore, DNet checks the best performance in the ChestXray-14 data set on traditional CNN, and it is validated that DNet performs better with a higher level of total depth.","['1 COMSATS University Islamabad, Pakistan.', '2 National University of Sciences and Technology (NUST), Islamabad, Pakistan.', '3 Shaheed Benazir Bhutto Women University Peshawar, Pakistan.', '4 Department of Computer Science, University of Gujrat, Gujrat, Pakistan.', '5 Centre for Smart Systems, AI and Cybersecurity, Staffordshire University, Stoke-on-Trent, United Kingdom.', '6 Research centre for AI and IoT, Near East University, Nicosia, Mersin 10, Turkey.']","Faizan Karim, Munam Ali Shah, Hasan Ali Khattak, Zoobia Ameer, Umar Shoaib, Hafiz Tayyab Rauf, Fadi Al-Turjman, ",Applied soft computing,NO_DATE,Capsule Networks; Chest X-ray; Deep learning; Lungs X-ray; Structural imaging; convolutional Neural Network.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35662915
39,Neuro-Retina Might Reflect Alzheimer's Disease Stage,"Background:
        
      
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathological hallmarks were found in retinas of AD patients. Several studies showed a significant reduction of neuro-retina thickness measured through optical coherence tomography (OCT) in AD patients, but possible correlations between retina morphology, cognition, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) AD biomarkers (Aβ42, t-tau, and p-tau) have been poorly investigated so far. Objective:
        
      
      In the present cross-sectional study, we measured the thickness of neuro-retinal layers through OCT searching for possible correlations with patients' cognitive performances and CSF AD biomarkers. Methods:
        
      
      137 consecutive subjects [43 with AD, 37 with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 57 healthy controls (HC)], received an OCT scan acquisition to measure the peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness. In a subsample of 21 AD, 18 MCI, and 18 HC, the macular volume of ganglion cell layer (GCL), inner plexiform layer (IPL), and inner nuclear layer was computed. A comprehensive neuropsychological assessment and CSF AD biomarkers' concentrations were available in AD and MCI patients. Results:
        
      
      Peripapillary RNFL, global, and in superior quadrant was significantly thinner in AD and MCI patients when compared to HC, while macular GCL volume was significantly reduced only in AD. RNFL thickness in nasal and inferior quadrants was correlated with single CSF AD biomarker concentrations, but no differences were found in retina morphology depending on the presence of a CSF profile typical for AD. Memory performances were positively associated with GCL and IPL volume. Conclusion:

Thus it is an urgent task for developing high-efficiency, low-toxicity and targeted drugs according to pathogenesis of coronavirus. In this paper, a novel disease-related compound identification model-based capsule network (CapsNet) is proposed. According to pneumonia-related keywords, the prescriptions and active components related to the pharmacological mechanism of disease are collected and extracted in order to construct training set. The features of each component are extracted as the input layer of capsule network. CapsNet is trained and utilized to identify the pneumonia-related compounds in Qingre Jiedu injection.

Existing automatic classification methods are based on the training of a large data set, which is challenging to apply in mines without a long-term manual data processing. In this paper, we present a method to automatically classify microseismic records with limited samples in underground mines based on capsule networks (CapsNet). We divide each microseismic record into 33 frames, then extract 21 commonly used features in time and frequency from each frame. Consequently, a 21 × 33 feature matrix is utilized as the input of CapsNet. On this basis, we use different sizes of training sets to train the classification models separately. The trained model is tested using the same test set containing 3,200 microseismic records and compared to convolutional neural networks (CNN) and traditional machine learning methods. Results show that the accuracy of our proposed method is 99.2% with limited training samples.

      Computational methods for protein post-translational modification (PTM) site prediction provide a useful approach for studying protein functions. The prediction accuracy of the existing methods has significant room for improvement. A recent deep-learning architecture, Capsule Network (CapsNet), which can characterize the internal hierarchical representation of input data, presents a great opportunity to solve this problem, especially using small training data. Results:
        
      
      We proposed a CapsNet for predicting protein PTM sites, including phosphorylation, N-linked glycosylation, N6-acetyllysine, methyl-arginine, S-palmitoyl-cysteine, pyrrolidone-carboxylic-acid and SUMOylation sites. The CapsNet outperformed the baseline convolutional neural network architecture MusiteDeep and other well-known tools in most cases and provided promising results for practical use, especially in learning from small training data. The capsule length also gives an accurate estimate for the confidence of the PTM prediction. We further demonstrated that the internal capsule features could be trained as a motif detector of phosphorylation sites when no kinase-specific phosphorylation labels were provided. In addition, CapsNet generates robust representations that have strong discriminant power in distinguishing kinase substrates from different kinase families. Our study sheds some light on the recognition mechanism of PTMs and applications of CapsNet on other bioinformatic problems. Availability and implementation:

43,Motor Imagery EEG Classification Using Capsule Networks,"Various convolutional neural network (CNN)-based approaches have been recently proposed to improve the performance of motor imagery based-brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). However, the classification accuracy of CNNs is compromised when target data are distorted. Specifically for motor imagery electroencephalogram (EEG), the measured signals, even from the same person, are not consistent and can be significantly distorted. To overcome these limitations, we propose to apply a capsule network (CapsNet) for learning various properties of EEG signals, thereby achieving better and more robust performance than previous CNN methods. The proposed CapsNet-based framework classifies the two-class motor imagery, namely right-hand and left-hand movements. The motor imagery EEG signals are first transformed into 2D images using the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) algorithm and then used for training and testing the capsule network. The performance of the proposed framework was evaluated on the BCI competition IV 2b dataset. The proposed framework outperformed state-of-the-art CNN-based methods and various conventional machine learning approaches.

44,Multisample Online Learning for Probabilistic Spiking Neural Networks,"Spiking neural networks (SNNs) capture some of the efficiency of biological brains for inference and learning via the dynamic, online, and event-driven processing of binary time series. Most existing learning algorithms for SNNs are based on deterministic neuronal models, such as leaky integrate-and-fire, and rely on heuristic approximations of backpropagation through time that enforces constraints such as locality. In contrast, probabilistic SNN models can be trained directly via principled online, local, and update rules that have proven to be particularly effective for resource-constrained systems. This article investigates another advantage of probabilistic SNNs, namely, their capacity to generate independent outputs when queried over the same input. It is shown that the multiple generated output samples can be used during inference to robustify decisions and to quantify uncertainty-a feature that deterministic SNN models cannot provide. Furthermore, they can be leveraged for training in order to obtain more accurate statistical estimates of the log-loss training criterion and its gradient. Specifically, this article introduces an online learning rule based on generalized expectation-maximization (GEM) that follows a three-factor form with global learning signals and is referred to as GEM-SNN.

45,Endogenous functioning and light response of the retinal clock in vertebrates,"Daily rhythms in behavior and physiology are programmed by a hierarchical group of biological clocks widely distributed in tissues and synchronized by the environmental day/night cycle. The retina is a remarkable model of circadian clock because it gathers photoreception, self-sustained oscillator function and physiological outputs within the same tissue. This clock plays a crucial function in adapting retinal physiology and visual function to the day/night changes and by regulating processes that are directly linked to retinal survival and phototoxicity. This article provides a comprehensive review of retinal circadian rhythms in vertebrates. Based on clock gene/protein expression, studies have shown that different cells within the retina are capable of generating sustained oscillations. However, this expression is divergent across vertebrate retinas with photoreceptors described as the primary site of rhythm generation in amphibians while in mammals, the current prevailing view is that each cell expresses the molecular clock machinery. First, we will present the molecular clock mechanisms at the origin of circadian rhythms, the retinal clock targets and then provide recent data about the mechanisms of light synchronization in an attempt to shed light on the role of the retinal clock in vertebrates.","['1 Univ Lyon, Université Claude Bernard Lyon 1, Inserm, Stem Cell and Brain Research Institute, Bron, France.', '2 Salk Institute for Biological Studies, La Lolla, CA, United States.', '3 Univ Lyon, Université Claude Bernard Lyon 1, Inserm, Stem Cell and Brain Research Institute, Bron, France.

46,COVID-19 early detection for imbalanced or low number of data using a regularized cost-sensitive CapsNet,"With the presence of novel coronavirus disease at the end of 2019, several approaches were proposed to help physicians detect the disease, such as using deep learning to recognize lung involvement based on the pattern of pneumonia. These approaches rely on analyzing the CT images and exploring the COVID-19 pathologies in the lung. Most of the successful methods are based on the deep learning technique, which is state-of-the-art. Nevertheless, the big drawback of the deep approaches is their need for many samples, which is not always possible. This work proposes a combined deep architecture that benefits both employed architectures of DenseNet and CapsNet. To more generalize the deep model, we propose a regularization term with much fewer parameters. The network convergence significantly improved, especially when the number of training data is small. We also propose a novel Cost-sensitive loss function for imbalanced data that makes our model feasible for the condition with a limited number of positive data. Our novelties make our approach more intelligent and potent in real-world situations with imbalanced data, popular in hospitals. We analyzed our approach on two publicly available datasets, HUST and COVID-CT, with different protocols. In the first protocol of HUST, we followed the original paper setup and outperformed it. With the second protocol of HUST, we show our approach superiority concerning imbalanced data.

47,Convolutional capsnet: A novel artificial neural network approach to detect COVID-19 disease from X-ray images using capsule networks,"Coronavirus is an epidemic that spreads very quickly. For this reason, it has very devastating effects in many areas worldwide. It is vital to detect COVID-19 diseases as quickly as possible to restrain the spread of the disease. The similarity of COVID-19 disease with other lung infections makes the diagnosis difficult. In addition, the high spreading rate of COVID-19 increased the need for a fast system for the diagnosis of cases. For this purpose, interest in various computer-aided (such as CNN, DNN, etc.) deep learning models has been increased. In these models, mostly radiology images are applied to determine the positive cases. Recent studies show that, radiological images contain important information in the detection of coronavirus. In this study, a novel artificial neural network, Convolutional CapsNet for the detection of COVID-19 disease is proposed by using chest X-ray images with capsule networks. The proposed approach is designed to provide fast and accurate diagnostics for COVID-19 diseases with binary classification (COVID-19, and No-Findings), and multi-class classification (COVID-19, and No-Findings, and Pneumonia). The proposed method achieved an accuracy of 97.24%, and 84.22% for binary class, and multi-class, respectively. It is thought that the proposed method may help physicians to diagnose COVID-19 disease and increase the diagnostic performance.

Due to the changeable structures of the flow, the prediction of superficial velocity of oil-water two-phase flow in large diameter pipes is still a challenging problem. Therefore, we first conducted a vertical upward oil-water two-phase flow experiment in a 125 mm ID pipe, and obtained the response signals under different flow conditions by a vertical multi-electrode array (VMEA) conductance sensor. Then, new data pre-processing (1D to 2D) techniques and information fusion techniques (network channels) are employed. Moreover, the front-end structure of the network is optimized using a combination of attention block and residual structure, and the middle structure is optimized using inception block; on the other hand, the back-end structure of the original capsule network is innovatively changed so that it can handle both the flow pattern classification and superficial velocity prediction tasks. The dynamic routing algorithm has also been improved to speed up model training. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the improved modules. Finally, we compare the proposed network with its variants and other competing networks. The better performance results show that our multi-task sequence-based CapsNet has great potential for dealing with high-dimensional, time-varying and nonlinear problems in multiphase flow.","[""1 School of Electrical and Information Engineering, Tianjin University, Tianjin, 300072, People's Republic of China.

49,Incomplete Recovery of Zebrafish Retina Following Cryoinjury,"Zebrafish show an extraordinary potential for regeneration in several organs from fins to central nervous system. Most impressively, the outcome of an injury results in a near perfect regeneration and a full functional recovery. Indeed, among the various injury paradigms previously tested in the field of zebrafish retina regeneration, a perfect layered structure is observed after one month of recovery in most of the reported cases. In this study, we applied cryoinjury to the zebrafish eye. We show that retina exposed to this treatment for one second undergoes an acute damage affecting all retinal cell types, followed by a phase of limited tissue remodeling and regrowth. Surprisingly, zebrafish developed a persistent retinal dysplasia observable through 300 days post-injury. There is no indication of fibrosis during the regeneration period, contrary to the regeneration process after cryoinjury to the zebrafish cardiac ventricle. RNA sequencing analysis of injured retinas at different time points has uncovered enriched processes and a number of potential candidate genes. By means of this simple, time and cost-effective technique, we propose a zebrafish injury model that displays a unique inability to completely recover following focal retinal damage; an outcome that is unreported to our knowledge. Furthermore, RNA sequencing proved to be useful in identifying pathways, which may play a crucial role not only in the regeneration of the retina, but in the first initial step of regeneration, degeneration. We propose that this model may prove useful in comparative and translational studies to examine critical pathways for successful regeneration.","['1 Institute for Research in Ophthalmology, 1950 Sion, Switzerland.', '2 Global Health Institute, School of Life Sciences, École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, 1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.', '3 Faculty of Biology and Medicine, University of Lausanne, 1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.']","Denisa Džulová, Dylan Lawless, Gaëtan G Pinton, Nicole A Renner, Daniel F Schorderet, ",Cells,2022,cryoinjury; regeneration; retina; zebrafish.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35456052
50,NeuroSEE: A Neuromorphic Energy-Efficient Processing Framework for Visual Prostheses,"Visual prostheses with both comprehensive visual signal processing capability and energy efficiency are becoming increasingly demanded in the age of intelligent personal healthcare, particularly with the rise of wearable and implantable devices. To address this trend, we propose NeuroSEE, a neuromorphic energy-efficient processing framework that combines a spike representation encoding technique and a bio-inspired processing method. This framework first utilizes sparse spike trains to represent visual information, and then a bio-inspired spiking neural network (SNN) is adopted to process the spike trains. The SNN model makes use of an IF neuron with multiple spike-firing rates to decrease the energy consumption without compensating for prediction performance. The experimental results indicate that when predicting the response of the primary visual cortex, the framework achieves a state-of-the-art Pearson correlation coefficient performance. Spike-based recording and processing methods simplify the storage and transmission of redundant scene information and complex calculation processes. It could reduce power consumption by 15 times compared with the existing Convolutional neural network (CNN) processing framework. The proposed NeuroSEE framework predicts the response of the primary visual cortex in an energy efficient manner, making it a powerful tool for visual prostheses.",NO_AFFILIATIONS,"Chuanqing Wang, Jie Yang, Mohamad Sawan, ",IEEE journal of biomedical and health informatics,NO_DATE,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35503849
51,Prediction of Citrullination Sites on the Basis of mRMR Method and SNN,"Background:
        
      
      Citrullination, an important post-translational modification of proteins, alters the molecular weight and electrostatic charge of the protein side chains. Citrulline, in protein sequences, is catalyzed by a class of Peptidyl Arginine Deiminases (PADs). Dependent on Ca2+, PADs include five isozymes: PAD 1, 2, 3, 4/5, and 6. Citrullinated proteins have been identified in many biological and pathological processes. Among them, abnormal protein citrullination modification can lead to serious human diseases, including multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis. Objective:
        
      
      It is important to identify the citrullination sites in protein sequences. The accurate identification of citrullination sites may contribute to the studies on the molecular functions and pathological mechanisms of related diseases. Methods and results:
        
      
      In this study, after an encoded training set (containing 116 positive and 348 negative samples) into the feature matrix, the mRMR method was used to analyze the 941- dimensional features which were sorted on the basis of their importance. Then, a predictive model based on a self-normalizing neural network (SNN) was proposed to predict the citrullination sites in protein sequences. Incremental Feature Selection (IFS) and 10-fold cross-validation were used as the model evaluation method. Three classical machine learning models, namely random forest, support vector machine, and k-nearest neighbor algorithm, were selected and compared with the SNN prediction model using the same evaluation methods. SNN may be the best tool for citrullination site prediction. The maximum value of the Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) reached 0.672404 on the basis of the optimal classifier of SNN. Conclusion:
        
      
      The results showed that the SNN-based prediction methods performed better when evaluated by some common metrics, such as MCC, accuracy, and F1-Measure. SNN prediction model also achieved a better balance in the classification and recognition of positive and negative samples from datasets compared with the other three models.","['1 College of Information Engineering, Shanghai Maritime University, Shanghai 201306, China.']","Min Liu, Guangzhong Liu, ",Combinatorial chemistry & high throughput screening,NO_DATE,"IFS (incremental feature selection); PTM (post-translational modification); SNN (self-normalizing neural network); citrullination site; mRMR

52,Multitarget Activities of Müller Glial Cells and Low-Density Lipoprotein Receptor-Related Protein 1 in Proliferative Retinopathies,"Müller glial cells (MGCs), the main glial component of the retina, play an active role in retinal homeostasis during development and pathological processes. They strongly monitor retinal environment and, in response to retinal imbalance, activate neuroprotective mechanisms mainly characterized by the increase of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). Under these circumstances, if homeostasis is not reestablished, the retina can be severely injured and GFAP contributes to neuronal degeneration, as they occur in several proliferative retinopathies such as diabetic retinopathy, sickle cell retinopathy and retinopathy of prematurity. In addition, MGCs have an active participation in inflammatory responses releasing proinflammatory mediators and metalloproteinases to the extracellular space and vitreous cavity. MGCs are also involved in the retinal neovascularization and matrix extracellular remodeling during the proliferative stage of retinopathies. Interestingly, low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) and its ligand α2-macroglobulin (α2M) are highly expressed in MGCs and they have been established to participate in multiple cellular and molecular activities with relevance in retinopathies. However, the exact mechanism of regulation of retinal LRP1 in MGCs is still unclear. Thus, the active participation of MGCs and LRP1 in these diseases, strongly supports the potential interest of them for the design of novel therapeutic approaches. In this review, we discuss the role of LRP1 in the multiple MGCs activities involved in the development and progression of proliferative retinopathies, identifying opportunities in the field that beg further research in this topic area.Summary StatementMGCs and LRP1 are active players in injured retinas, participating in key features such as gliosis and neurotoxicity, neovascularization, inflammation, and glucose control homeostasis during the progression of ischemic diseases, such as proliferative retinopathies.","['1 Universidad Nacional de Córdoba, Facultad de Ciencias Químicas, Departamento de Bioquímica Clínica, Córdoba, Argentina.', '2 62873Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas (CONICET), Centro de Investigaciones en Bioquímica Clínica e Inmunología (CIBICI), Córdoba, Argentina.', '3 602578Instituto Universitario de Ciencias Biomédicas de Córdoba (IUCBC), Centro de Investigación en Medicina Traslacional Severo R.

Directly applying backpropagation to the training of the SNN still has a performance gap compared with traditional deep neural networks. To address the problem, we propose a biologically plausible spatial adjustment that rethinks the relationship between membrane potential and spikes and realizes a reasonable adjustment of gradients to different time steps. It precisely controls the backpropagation of the error along the spatial dimension. Secondly, we propose a biologically plausible temporal adjustment to make the error propagate across the spikes in the temporal dimension, which overcomes the problem of the temporal dependency within a single spike period of traditional spiking neurons. We have verified our algorithm on several datasets, and the experimental results have shown that our algorithm greatly reduces network latency and energy consumption while also improving network performance.","['1 Research Center for Brain-Inspired Intelligence, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100190, China.', '2 School of Future Technology, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100190, China.', '3 Center for Excellence in Brain Science and Intelligence Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 200031, China.', '4 National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100190, China.', '5 School of Artificial Intelligence, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100190, China.']","Guobin Shen, Dongcheng Zhao, Yi Zeng, ","Patterns (New York, N.Y.)",2022,SNN; backpropagation; biologically plausible spatial adjustment; biologically plausible temporal adjustment; low energy consumption; low latency; spiking neural network; surrogate gradient.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35755868

      We propose a 3-D tumor computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) system with U-net and a residual-capsule neural network (Res-CapsNet) for ABUS images and provide a reference for early tumor diagnosis, especially non-mass lesions. Methods:
        
      
      A total of 396 patients with 444 tumors (226 malignant and 218 benign) were retrospectively enrolled from Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center. In our CADx, preprocessing was performed first to crop and resize the tumor volumes of interest (VOIs). Then, a 3-D U-net and postprocessing were applied to the VOIs to obtain tumor masks. Finally, a 3-D Res-CapsNet classification model was executed with the VOIs and the corresponding masks to diagnose the tumors. Finally, the diagnostic performance, including accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve (AUC), was compared with other classification models and among three readers with different years of experience in ABUS review. Results:
        
      
      For all tumors, the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and AUC of the proposed CADx were 84.9 %, 87.2 %, 82.6 %, and 0.9122, respectively, outperforming other models and junior reader. Next, the tumors were subdivided into mass and non-mass tumors to validate the system performance. For mass tumors, our CADx achieved an accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and AUC of 85.2 %, 88.2 %, 82.3 %, and 0.9147, respectively, which was higher than that of other models and junior reader. For non-mass tumors, our CADx achieved an accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and AUC of 81.6 %, 78.3 %, 86.7 %, and 0.8654, respectively, outperforming the two readers. Conclusion:

55,Capsule Network for ERP Detection in Brain-Computer Interface,"Event-related potential (ERP) is bioelectrical activity that occurs in the brain in response to specific events or stimuli, reflecting the electrophysiological changes in the brain during cognitive processes. ERP is important in cognitive neuroscience and has been applied to brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). However, because ERP signals collected on the scalp are weak, mixed with spontaneous electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, and their temporal and spatial features are complex, accurate ERP detection is challenging. Compared to traditional neural networks, the capsule network (CapsNet) replaces scalar-output neurons with vector-output capsules, allowing the various input information to be well preserved in the capsules. In this study, we expect to utilize CapsNet to extract the discriminative spatial-temporal features of ERP and encode them in capsules to reduce the loss of valuable information, thereby improving the ERP detection performance for BCI. Therefore, we propose ERP-CapsNet to perform ERP detection in a BCI speller application. The experimental results on BCI Competition datasets and the Akimpech dataset show that ERP-CapsNet achieves better classification performances than do the state-of-the-art techniques. We also use a decoder to investigate the attributes of ERPs encoded in capsules. The results show that ERP-CapsNet relies on the P300 and P100 components to detect ERP. Therefore, ERP-CapsNet not only acts as an outstanding method for ERP detection, but also provides useful insights into the ERP detection mechanism.",NO_AFFILIATIONS,"Ronghua Ma, Tianyou Yu, Xiaoli Zhong, Zhu Liang Yu, Yuanqing Li, Zhenghui Gu, ",IEEE transactions on neural systems and rehabilitation engineering : a publication of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society,NO_DATE,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33793402
56,A Parallel Spiking Neural Network Based on Adaptive Lateral Inhibition Mechanism for Objective Recognition,"Spiking neural network (SNN) has attracted extensive attention in the field of machine learning because of its biological interpretability and low power consumption. However, the accuracy of pattern recognition cannot completely surpass deep neural networks (DNNs). The main reason is that the inherent nondifferentiability of spiking neurons makes SNN unable to be trained directly by the gradient descent algorithm, and there is also no unified training algorithm for SNN. Inspired by the biological vision system, this paper proposes a parallel convolution SNN structure combined with an adaptive lateral inhibition mechanism. And, a way of dynamically evolving the time constant with the training of SNN is proposed to ensure the diversity of neurons. This paper verifies the effectiveness of the proposed methods on static datasets and neuromorphic datasets and extends it to the recognition of breast tumors. Experimental results show that the SNN has obvious advantages in dynamical datasets. For breast tumors, it is also an edge-based task, because the edge of a medical image contains the most important information in the image. This kind of information can provide great help for the noninvasive and accurate diagnosis of diseases. The Experimental results show that the proposed method is very close to the recognition results of DNNs on static datasets, and its performance on neuromorphic datasets exceeds that of DNNs.","['1 College of Computer Science and Technology, Harbin Engineering University, Harbin 150001, China.']","Qiang Fu, Hongbin Dong, ",Computational intelligence and neuroscience,2022,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36275955

An artificial spiking tactile neuron based on an ovonic threshold switch serving as an artificial soma and a piezoresistive sensor as an artificial mechanoreceptor is developed and shown to encode the elastic stiffness of pressed materials into spike frequency evolution patterns. SNN-based learning of ultrasound elastography images abstracted by spike frequency evolution rate enables the classification of malignancy status of breast tumors with a recognition accuracy up to 95.8%. The stiffness-encoding artificial tactile neuron and learning of spiking-represented stiffness patterns hold a great promise for the identification and classification of tumors for disease diagnosis and robot-assisted surgery with low power consumption, low latency, and yet high accuracy.","['1 Post-Silicon Semiconductor Institute, Korea Institute of Science and Technology, Seoul, 02792, Republic of Korea.', '2 YU-KIST, Yonsei University, Seoul, 03722, Republic of Korea.', '3 Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, 03722, Republic of Korea.', '4 Center for Neuromorphic Engineering, Korea Institute of Science and Technology, Seoul, 02792, Republic of Korea.', '5 Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, 02841, Republic of Korea.', '6 Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, 08826, Republic of Korea.', '7 Department of Radiology, Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seongnam, 13620, Republic of Korea.', '8 Division of Nano & Information Technology, Korea University of Science and Technology, Daejeon, 34316, Republic of Korea.']","Junseok Lee, Seonjeong Kim, Seongjin Park, Jaesang Lee, Wonseop Hwang, Seong Won Cho, Kyuho Lee, Sun Mi Kim, Tae-Yeon Seong, Cheolmin Park, Suyoun Lee, Hyunjung Yi, ","Advanced materials (Deerfield Beach, Fla.)",NO_DATE,artificial tactile neurons; disease diagnosis; elastography; neuromorphic sensors; ovonic threshold switching; piezoresistive sensors; spiking neural networks.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35436369
58,Memory-inspired spiking hyperdimensional network for robust online learning,"Recently, brain-inspired computing models have shown great potential to outperform today's deep learning solutions in terms of robustness and energy efficiency. Particularly, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) and HyperDimensional Computing (HDC) have shown promising results in enabling efficient and robust cognitive learning. Despite the success, these two brain-inspired models have different strengths. While SNN mimics the physical properties of the human brain, HDC models the brain on a more abstract and functional level. Their design philosophies demonstrate complementary patterns that motivate their combination. With the help of the classical psychological model on memory, we propose SpikeHD, the first framework that fundamentally combines Spiking neural network and hyperdimensional computing. SpikeHD generates a scalable and strong cognitive learning system that better mimics brain functionality. SpikeHD exploits spiking neural networks to extract low-level features by preserving the spatial and temporal correlation of raw event-based spike data. Then, it utilizes HDC to operate over SNN output by mapping the signal into high-dimensional space, learning the abstract information, and classifying the data. Our extensive evaluation on a set of benchmark classification problems shows that SpikeHD provides the following benefit compared to SNN architecture: (1) significantly enhance learning capability by exploiting two-stage information processing, (2) enables substantial robustness to noise and failure, and (3) reduces the network size and required parameters to learn complex information.","['1 University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, 92093, USA.', '2 University of California Irvine, Irvine, CA, 92697, USA.', '3 University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, 90095, USA.', '4 University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT, 06269, USA.', '5 Daegu Gyeongbuk Institute of Science and Technology, Daegu, South Korea.', '6 University of Louisiana, Lafayette, LA, 70504, USA.', '7 University of California Irvine, Irvine, CA, 92697, USA. m.imani@uci.edu.']","Zhuowen Zou, Haleh Alimohamadi, Ali Zakeri, Farhad Imani, Yeseong Kim, M Hassan Najafi, Mohsen Imani, ",Scientific reports,2022,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35538126
59,Coculture of ARPE-19 Cells and Porcine Neural Retina as an Ex Vivo Retinal Model,"Neural retinal organ cultures are used to investigate ocular pathomechanisms. However, these cultures lack the essential retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells, which are part of the actual in vivo retina. To simulate a more realistic ex vivo model, porcine neural retina explants were cocultured with ARPE-19 cells (ARPE-19 group), which are derived from human RPE. To identify whether the entire cells or just the cell factors are necessary, in a second experimental group, porcine neural retina explants were cultured with medium derived from ARPE-19 cells (medium group). Individually cultured neural retina explants served as controls (control group). After 8 days, all neural retinas were analysed to evaluate retinal thickness, photoreceptors, microglia, complement factors and synapses (n = 6-8 per group). The neural retina thickness in the ARPE-19 group was significantly better preserved than in the control group (p = 0.031). Also, the number of L-cones was higher in the ARPE-19 group, as compared to the control group (p < 0.001). Furthermore, the ARPE-19 group displayed an increased presynaptic glutamate uptake (determined via vGluT1 labelling) and enhanced post-synaptic density (determined via PSD-95 labelling). Combined Iba1 and iNOS detection revealed only minor effects of ARPE-19 cells on microglial activity, with a slight downregulation of total microglia activity apparent in the medium group. Likewise, only minor beneficial effects on photoreceptors and synaptic structure were found in the medium group. This novel system offers the opportunity to investigate interactions between the neural retina and RPE cells, and suggests that the inclusion of a RPE feeder layer has beneficial effects on the ex vivo maintenance of neural retina. By modifying the culture conditions, this coculture model allows a better understanding of photoreceptor death and photoreceptor-RPE cell interactions in retinal diseases.","['1 Experimental Eye Research Institute, University Eye Hospital, 9142Ruhr-University Bochum, Germany.', '2 Centre for Ophthalmology Tübingen, 27203University Eye Hospital Tübingen, Germany.']","Natalie Wagner, Armin Safaei, Pia A Vogt, Maurice R Gammel, H Burkhard Dick, Sven Schnichels, Stephanie C Joachim, ",Alternatives to laboratory animals : ATLA,NO_DATE,adult retinal pigment epithelial cell line-19; coculture; neural retina; photoreceptors; porcine retina; retinal pigment epithelium.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35302924

The optimization scheme explores the impact of biological time constants on information transmission in the SNN and improves the convergence rate of the SNN on digit recognition with a suitable choice of the time constants. The parallel digital implementation leads to a significant speedup over software simulation on a general-purpose CPU. The parallel implementation with the Euler method enables around 180× ( 20× ) training (inference) speedup over a Pytorch-based SNN simulation on CPU. Moreover, compared with previous work, our parallel implementation shows more than 300× ( 240× ) improvement on speed and 180× ( 250× ) reduction in energy consumption for training (inference). In addition, due to the high-order accuracy, the RK3 method is demonstrated to gain 2× training speedup over the Euler method, which makes it suitable for online training in real-time applications.",NO_AFFILIATIONS,"Wenzhe Guo, Hasan Erdem Yantir, Mohammed E Fouda, Ahmed M Eltawil, Khaled Nabil Salama, ",IEEE transactions on neural networks and learning systems,NO_DATE,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33571097
61,Nonvolatile Memory Materials for Neuromorphic Intelligent Machines,"Recent progress in deep learning extends the capability of artificial intelligence to various practical tasks, making the deep neural network (DNN) an extremely versatile hypothesis. While such DNN is virtually built on contemporary data centers of the von Neumann architecture, physical (in part) DNN of non-von Neumann architecture, also known as neuromorphic computing, can remarkably improve learning and inference efficiency. Particularly, resistance-based nonvolatile random access memory (NVRAM) highlights its handy and efficient application to the multiply-accumulate (MAC) operation in an analog manner. Here, an overview is given of the available types of resistance-based NVRAMs and their technological maturity from the material- and device-points of view. Examples within the strategy are subsequently addressed in comparison with their benchmarks (virtual DNN in deep learning). A spiking neural network (SNN) is another type of neural network that is more biologically plausible than the DNN. The successful incorporation of resistance-based NVRAM in SNN-based neuromorphic computing offers an efficient solution to the MAC operation and spike timing-based learning in nature. This strategy is exemplified from a material perspective. Intelligent machines are categorized according to their architecture and learning type.

63,Inflammatory and cell death mechanisms induced by 7-ketocholesterol in the retina. Implications for age-related macular degeneration,"This review will focus on the inflammatory and toxic mechanism of action of 7-ketocholesterol (7KCh) and the potential implications of its accumulation, especially in the retina. 7KCh is a pro-inflammatory oxysterol usually associated with oxidized lipoprotein deposits present in aged retinas. High amounts of 7KCh can be generated in situ in these lipoprotein deposits possibly through a free radical-mediated mechanism catalyzed by iron. 7KCh seems to activate several kinase signaling pathways that work via multiple transcription factors to induce cytokines and intracellular effectors causing cell death. There seems to be a controversy in the literature in relation to the mechanisms of death induced by 7KCh. Some of the discrepancies arise from the way the oxysterol is delivered because different signaling pathways are activated in different experimental setups. The elucidation of the inflammatory and toxic mechanisms is crucial for the discovery and design of new therapies. Importantly, there is little evidence of 7KCh detoxifying mechanisms in the retina, although some potential enzymes have been described. Thus, continuous formation throughout life and potential toxicity of 7KCh points it out as an ""age-related"" risk factor in pathologies such as age-related macular degeneration.","['1 Biomarkers and Molecular Signaling Group, Neurodegeneration Area, Center for Biomedical Research of La Rioja (CIBIR), Piqueras 98, 26006, Logroño, Spain.', '2 Biomarkers and Molecular Signaling Group, Neurodegeneration Area, Center for Biomedical Research of La Rioja (CIBIR), Piqueras 98, 26006, Logroño, Spain.

Sequential cell fate determination evidenced by the first appearance of cell-type-specific marker labeling was at embryonic stage 18 (E18) with ganglion cells (Brn-3A, HuC/D) and microglia (Iba1); at E22.5 with photoreceptor progenitors (Otx2, recoverin) followed shortly by horizontal and amacrine cells (Lhx1, Oc1) at E24 to E25.5; and at postnatal stage 15 (P15) with bipolar cells (Vsx1, CaBP5) and Müller glia cells (GS, Rlbp1). Photoreceptor maturation indicated by opsin-positive outer segments and peanut agglutinin (PNA) labeling of cone sheaths was completed at the time of eye opening (P21-P24). Conclusions:
        
      
      The timeline and order of retinal cell development in the 13-LGS generally matches that recorded from other mammalian models but with a stark variation in the proportion of various cell types due to cone-dense photoreceptors. Translational relevance:

67,An imageomics and multi-network based deep learning model for risk assessment of liver transplantation for hepatocellular cancer,"Introduction:
        
      
      Liver transplantation (LT) is an effective treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most common type of primary liver cancer. Patients with small HCC (<5 cm) are given priority over others for transplantation due to clinical allocation policies based on tumor size. Attempting to shift from the prevalent paradigm that successful transplantation and longer disease-free survival can only be achieved in patients with small HCC to expanding the transplantation option to patients with HCC of the highest tumor burden (>5 cm), we developed a convergent artificial intelligence (AI) model that combines transient clinical data with quantitative histologic and radiomic features for more objective risk assessment of liver transplantation for HCC patients. Methods:
        
      
      Patients who received a LT for HCC between 2008-2019 were eligible for inclusion in the analysis. All patients with post-LT recurrence were included, and those without recurrence were randomly selected for inclusion in the deep learning model. Pre- and post-transplant magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans and reports were compressed using CapsNet networks and natural language processing, respectively, as input for a multiple feature radial basis function network. We applied a histological image analysis algorithm to detect pathologic areas of interest from explant tissue of patients who recurred. The multilayer perceptron was designed as a feed-forward, supervised neural network topology, with the final assessment of recurrence risk. We used area under the curve (AUC) and F-1 score to assess the predictability of different network combinations. Results:
        
      
      A total of 109 patients were included (87 in the training group, 22 in the testing group), of which 20 were positive for cancer recurrence. Seven models (AUC; F-1 score) were generated, including clinical features only (0.55; 0.52), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) only (0.64; 0.61), pathological images only (0.64; 0.61), MRI plus pathology (0.68; 0.65), MRI plus clinical (0.78, 0.75), pathology plus clinical (0.77; 0.73), and a combination of clinical, MRI, and pathology features (0.87; 0.84). The final combined model showed 80 % recall and 89 % precision. The total accuracy of the implemented model was 82 %. Conclusion:
        
      
      We validated that the deep learning model combining clinical features and multi-scale histopathologic and radiomic image features can be used to discover risk factors for recurrence beyond tumor size and biomarker analysis. Such a predictive, convergent AI model has the potential to alter the LT allocation system for HCC patients and expand the transplantation treatment option to patients with HCC of the highest tumor burden.","['1 Systems Medicine and Bioengineering Department, Houston Methodist Cancer Center and Departments of Radiology and Pathology, Houston Methodist Hospital, Weill Cornell Medicine, Houston, TX, 77030, United States.', '2 Department of Surgery, Houston Methodist Hospital, Houston, TX, 77030, United States.', '3 Department of Surgery, Houston Methodist Hospital, Houston, TX, 77030, United States; Center for Outcomes Research, Houston Methodist Research Institute, Houston, TX, 77030, United States.', '4 JC Walter Jr Transplant Center, Houston Methodist Hospital, Houston, TX, 77030, United States; Department of Medicine, Houston Methodist Hospital, Houston, TX, 77030, United States.', '5 Department of Clinical Pathology and Genomic Medicine, Houston Methodist Hospital, Houston, TX, 77030, United States.', '6 Department of Surgery, Houston Methodist Hospital, Houston, TX, 77030, United States; JC Walter Jr Transplant Center, Houston Methodist Hospital, Houston, TX, 77030, United States.

68,Survey of retinal ganglion cell morphology in marmoset,"In primate retina, the midget, parasol, and small bistratified cell populations form the large majority of ganglion cells. In addition, there is a variety of low-density wide-field ganglion cell types that are less well characterized. Here we studied retinal ganglion cells in the common marmoset, Callithrix jacchus, using particle-mediated gene transfer. Ganglion cells were transfected with an expression plasmid for the postsynaptic density 95-green fluorescent protein. The retinas were processed with established immunohistochemical markers for bipolar and/or amacrine cells to determine ganglion cell dendritic stratification. In total over 500 ganglion cells were classified based on their dendritic field size, morphology, and stratification in the inner plexiform layer. Over 17 types were distinguished, including midget, parasol, broad thorny, small bistratified, large bistratified, recursive bistratified, recursive monostratified, narrow thorny, smooth monostratified, large sparse, giant sparse (melanopsin) ganglion cells, and a group that may contain several as yet uncharacterized types. Assuming each characterized type forms a hexagonal mosaic, the midget and parasol cells account for over 80% of all ganglion cells in the central retina but only ∼50% of cells in the peripheral (>2 mm) retina. We conclude that the fovea is dominated by midget and parasol cells, but outside the fovea the ganglion cell diversity in marmoset is likely as great as that reported for nonprimate retinas. Taken together, the ganglion cell types in marmoset retina resemble those described previously in macaque retina with respect to morphology, stratification, and change in proportion across the retina.","['1 Save Sight Institute and Department of Clinical Ophthalmology, The University of Sydney, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.', '2 National Institutes of Natural Sciences, Tokyo, Japan.', '3 Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Integrative Brain Function, The University of Sydney, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.', '4 School of Medical Sciences, The University of Sydney, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.']","Rania A Masri, Kumiko A Percival, Amane Koizumi, Paul R Martin, Ulrike Grünert, ",The Journal of comparative neurology,2019,RRID: AB_10000340; RRID: AB_10000347; RRID: AB_2079751; RRID: AB_231413; RRID: AB_399431; midget cells; parasol cells; primate; wide-field ganglion cells.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27997691
69,Capsule Networks Showed Excellent Performance in the Classification of hERG Blockers/Nonblockers,"Capsule networks (CapsNets), a new class of deep neural network architectures proposed recently by Hinton et al., have shown a great performance in many fields, particularly in image recognition and natural language processing. However, CapsNets have not yet been applied to drug discovery-related studies. As the first attempt, we in this investigation adopted CapsNets to develop classification models of hERG blockers/nonblockers; drugs with hERG blockade activity are thought to have a potential risk of cardiotoxicity. Two capsule network architectures were established: convolution-capsule network (Conv-CapsNet) and restricted Boltzmann machine-capsule networks (RBM-CapsNet), in which convolution and a restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) were used as feature extractors, respectively. Two prediction models of hERG blockers/nonblockers were then developed by Conv-CapsNet and RBM-CapsNet with the Doddareddy's training set composed of 2,389 compounds. The established models showed excellent performance in an independent test set comprising 255 compounds, with prediction accuracies of 91.8 and 92.2% for Conv-CapsNet and RBM-CapsNet models, respectively. Various comparisons were also made between our models and those developed by other machine learning methods including deep belief network (DBN), convolutional neural network (CNN), multilayer perceptron (MLP), support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbors (kNN), logistic regression (LR), and LightGBM, and with different training sets. All the results showed that the models by Conv-CapsNet and RBM-CapsNet are among the best classification models. Overall, the excellent performance of capsule networks achieved in this investigation highlights their potential in drug discovery-related studies.","['1 State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy and Cancer Center, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.', '2 College of Preclinical Medicine, Southwest Medical University, Luzhou, China.', '3 School of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China.', '4 Basic Teaching Department, Sichuan College of Architectural Technology, Deyang, China.']","Yiwei Wang, Lei Huang, Siwen Jiang, Yifei Wang, Jun Zou, Hongguang Fu, Shengyong Yang, ",Frontiers in pharmacology,2020,Capsule network; classification model; convolution-capsule network; deep learning; hERG; restricted Boltzmann machine-capsule networks.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32063849

71,Advancements in Algorithms and Neuromorphic Hardware for Spiking Neural Networks,"Artificial neural networks (ANNs) have experienced a rapid advancement for their success in various application domains, including autonomous driving and drone vision. Researchers have been improving the performance efficiency and computational requirement of ANNs inspired by the mechanisms of the biological brain. Spiking neural networks (SNNs) provide a power-efficient and brain-inspired computing paradigm for machine learning applications. However, evaluating large-scale SNNs on classical von Neumann architectures (central processing units/graphics processing units) demands a high amount of power and time. Therefore, hardware designers have developed neuromorphic platforms to execute SNNs in and approach that combines fast processing and low power consumption. Recently, field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) have been considered promising candidates for implementing neuromorphic solutions due to their varied advantages, such as higher flexibility, shorter design, and excellent stability. This review aims to describe recent advances in SNNs and the neuromorphic hardware platforms (digital, analog, hybrid, and FPGA based) suitable for their implementation. We present that biological background of SNN learning, such as neuron models and information encoding techniques, followed by a categorization of SNN training. In addition, we describe state-of-the-art SNN simulators. Furthermore, we review and present FPGA-based hardware implementation of SNNs.

72,CapsNet-SSP: multilane capsule network for predicting human saliva-secretory proteins,"Background:
        
      
      Compared with disease biomarkers in blood and urine, biomarkers in saliva have distinct advantages in clinical tests, as they can be conveniently examined through noninvasive sample collection. Therefore, identifying human saliva-secretory proteins and further detecting protein biomarkers in saliva have significant value in clinical medicine. There are only a few methods for predicting saliva-secretory proteins based on conventional machine learning algorithms, and all are highly dependent on annotated protein features. Unlike conventional machine learning algorithms, deep learning algorithms can automatically learn feature representations from input data and thus hold promise for predicting saliva-secretory proteins. Results:
        
      
      We present a novel end-to-end deep learning model based on multilane capsule network (CapsNet) with differently sized convolution kernels to identify saliva-secretory proteins only from sequence information. The proposed model CapsNet-SSP outperforms existing methods based on conventional machine learning algorithms. Furthermore, the model performs better than other state-of-the-art deep learning architectures mostly used to analyze biological sequences. In addition, we further validate the effectiveness of CapsNet-SSP by comparison with human saliva-secretory proteins from existing studies and known salivary protein biomarkers of cancer. Conclusions:
        
      
      The main contributions of this study are as follows: (1) an end-to-end model based on CapsNet is proposed to identify saliva-secretory proteins from the sequence information; (2) the proposed model achieves better performance and outperforms existing models; and (3) the saliva-secretory proteins predicted by our model are statistically significant compared with existing cancer biomarkers in saliva. In addition, a web server of CapsNet-SSP is developed for saliva-secretory protein identification, and it can be accessed at the following URL: http://www.csbg-jlu.info/CapsNet-SSP/. We believe that our model and web server will be useful for biomedical researchers who are interested in finding salivary protein biomarkers, especially when they have identified candidate proteins for analyzing diseased tissues near or distal to salivary glands using transcriptome or proteomics.","['1 Key Laboratory of Symbol Computation and Knowledge Engineering of the Ministry of Education, College of Computer Science and Technology, Jilin University, Changchun, 130012, China.', '2 Center for Fundamental and Applied Microbiomics, Biodesign Institute, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, 85287, USA.', '3 Key Laboratory of Symbol Computation and Knowledge Engineering of the Ministry of Education, College of Computer Science and Technology, Jilin University, Changchun, 130012, China. liying@jlu.edu.cn.']","Wei Du, Yu Sun, Gaoyang Li, Huansheng Cao, Ran Pang, Ying Li, ",BMC bioinformatics,2020,Capsule network; Convolutional neural network; Deep learning; Saliva-secretory protein.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32517646
73,Characterization of retinal biomechanical properties using Brillouin microscopy,"Significance:
        
      
      The retina is critical for vision, and several diseases may alter its biomechanical properties. However, assessing the biomechanical properties of the retina nondestructively is a challenge due to its fragile nature and location within the eye globe. Advancements in Brillouin spectroscopy have provided the means for nondestructive investigations of retina biomechanical properties. Aim:
        
      
      We assessed the biomechanical properties of mouse retinas using Brillouin microscopy noninvasively and showed the potential of Brillouin microscopy to differentiate the type and layers of retinas based on stiffness. Approach:
        
      
      We used Brillouin microscopy to quantify stiffness of fresh and paraformaldehyde (PFA)-fixed retinas. As further proof-of-concept, we demonstrated a change in the stiffness of a retina with N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-induced damage, compared to an undamaged sample. Results:
        
      
      We found that the retina layers with higher cell body density had higher Brillouin modulus compared to less cell-dense layers. We have also demonstrated that PFA-fixed retina samples were stiffer compared with fresh samples. Further, NMDA-induced neurotoxicity leads to retinal ganglion cell (RGC) death and reactive gliosis, increasing the stiffness of the RGC layer. Conclusion:
        
      
      Brillouin microscopy can be used to characterize the stiffness distribution of the layers of the retina and can be used to differentiate tissue at different conditions based on biomechanical properties.","['1 University of Houston, Department of Biomedical Engineering, Houston, Texas, United States.', '2 University of Maryland, Fischell Department of Bioengineering, College Park, Maryland, United States.', '3 Baylor College of Medicine, Department of Molecular Physiology and Biophysics, Houston, Texas, United States.']","Yogeshwari S Ambekar, Manmohan Singh, Giuliano Scarcelli, Elda M Rueda, Benjamin M Hall, Ross A Poché, Kirill V Larin, ",Journal of biomedical optics,NO_DATE,Brillouin microscopy; N-methyl-D-aspartate; retina; retinal damage; retinal ganglion cells; tissue biomechanics.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32981240
74,Focal electrical stimulation of human retinal ganglion cells for vision restoration,"Objective. Vision restoration with retinal implants is limited by indiscriminate simultaneous activation of many cells and cell types, which is incompatible with reproducing the neural code of the retina. Recent work has shown that primate retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), which transmit visual information to the brain, can be directly electrically activated with single-cell, single-spike, cell-type precision - however, this possibility has never been tested in the human retina. In this study we aim to characterize, for the first time, direct in situ extracellular electrical stimulation of individual human RGCs.Approach. Extracellular electrical stimulation of individual human RGCs was conducted in three human retinas ex vivo using a custom large-scale, multi-electrode array capable of simultaneous recording and stimulation. Measured activation properties were compared directly to extensive results from macaque.Main results. Precise activation was in many cases possible without activating overlying axon bundles, at low stimulation current levels similar to those used in macaque. The major RGC types could be identified and targeted based on their distinctive electrical signatures. The measured electrical activation properties of RGCs, combined with a dynamic stimulation algorithm, was sufficient to produce an evoked visual signal that was nearly optimal given the constraints of the interface.Significance. These results suggest the possibility of high-fidelity vision restoration in humans using bi-directional epiretinal implants.","['1 Neurosciences PhD Program, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, United States of America.', '2 School of Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, United States of America.', '3 Hansen Experimental Physics Laboratory, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, United States of America.', '4 Department of Neurosurgery, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, United States of America.', '5 Department of Electrical Engineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, United States of America.', '6 Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, United States of America.', '7 Faculty of Physics and Applied Computer Science, AGH University of Science and Technology, Krakow, Poland.', '8 Santa Cruz Institute for Particle Physics, University of California, Santa Cruz, CA, United States of America.', '9 Department of Ophthalmology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, United States of America.']","Sasidhar S Madugula, Alex R Gogliettino, Moosa Zaidi, Gorish Aggarwal, Alexandra Kling, Nishal P Shah, Jeff B Brown, Ramandeep Vilkhu, Madeline R Hays, Huy Nguyen, Victoria Fan, Eric G Wu, Pawel Hottowy, Alexander Sher, Alan M Litke, Ruwan A Silva, E J Chichilnisky, ",Journal of neural engineering,2022,epiretinal implants; extracellular electrical stimulation; multi-electrode arrays; retina; translational neuro-rehabilitation.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36533865
75,On the mechanics of myopia and its influence on retinal detachment,"A mechanics-based mathematical model of retinal detachment due to the geometric changes of the eye associated with the evolution of myopia is developed. This includes deformation of the retina due to biological growth of the retina, as well as elastic deformation imposed on the retina by the myopic change in shape of the much stiffer choroid and sclera. The problem is formulated as a propagating boundary value problem in the calculus of variations, which yields self-consistent governing equations, boundary conditions, and transversality conditions that establish the location of the propagating boundaries that correspond to equilibrium configurations of the detaching ocular system. Axisymmetric conditions are considered, and exact, analytical solutions to the corresponding boundary value problem are obtained for detaching retinas with and without a tear. Based upon application of the model presented herein to the emmetropic retina, a value of the bond energy of the retina to retinal pigment epithelium interface is estimated using material properties found in the literature. Simulations based on the analytical solutions are performed for a detachment in the retina located at either the posterior or superior pole of the eye. The results support the clinical finding of an increased prevalence of retinal detachment in myopic eyes and provide insight into the potential causation for the increased prevalence.","['1 Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ, 08854, USA. joelak@rutgers.edu.', '2 Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ, 08854, USA.', '3 NJ Retina, Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, Rutgers University, 10 Plum St., Suite 600, New Brunswick, NJ, 08901, USA.']","Joseph M Lakawicz, William J Bottega, Howard F Fine, Jonathan L Prenner, ",Biomechanics and modeling in mechanobiology,NO_DATE,Biological growth; Elastic deformation; Myopia; Retina; Retinal detachment.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31650370

      Classically, ROP has been considered a neonatal disease only; however, pediatric ophthalmologists and retinal specialists worldwide are recently facing a new paradigm shift. retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is now considered a lifelong disease that extends well into adulthood. The purpose of this review is to describe the adult ROP anatomy and discuss the late sequelae and management of this disease. Recent findings:
        
      
      Neonatal ROP treatments affect both anterior and posterior segment anatomy. Anterior segment changes secondary to inflammation and posterior ciliary nerve ablation range from acute to chronic pathology, including cataract, secondary glaucoma, and corneal decompensation. Persistent avascular retina can be present in previously treated Type 1 ROP eyes after anti-vascular endothelial growth factor or in 'normal' untreated eyes that did not previously meet Type 1 ROP criteria. Persistent avascular retina is associated with lattice-like changes, retinal tears, and detachments. The location and extent of the ridge, posterior hyaloidal contraction and adhesion, and persistent avascular retina all contribute to a spectrum of findings ranging from reactivation of neovascularization, tractional, rhegmatogenous, or exudative detachments. Summary:

77,Slow-Varying Dynamics-Assisted Temporal Capsule Network for Machinery Remaining Useful Life Estimation,"Capsule network (CapsNet) acts as a promising alternative to the typical convolutional neural network, which is the dominant network to develop the remaining useful life (RUL) estimation models for mechanical equipment. Although CapsNet comes with an impressive ability to represent entities' hierarchical relationships through a high-dimensional vector embedding, it fails to capture the long-term temporal correlation of run-to-failure time series measured from degraded mechanical equipment. On the other hand, the slow-varying dynamics, which reveals the low-frequency information hidden in mechanical dynamical behavior, is overlooked in the existing RUL estimation models (including CapsNet), limiting the utmost ability of advanced networks. To address the aforementioned concerns, we propose a slow-varying dynamics-assisted temporal CapsNet (SD-TemCapsNet) to simultaneously learn the slow-varying dynamics and temporal dynamics from measurements for accurate RUL estimation. First, in light of the sensitivity of fault evolution, slow-varying features are decomposed from normal raw data to convey the low-frequency components corresponding to the system dynamics. Next, the long short-term memory (LSTM) mechanism is introduced into CapsNet to capture the temporal correlation of time series. To this end, experiments conducted on an aircraft engine and a milling machine verify that the proposed SD-TemCapsNet outperforms the mainstream methods. In comparison with CapsNet, the estimation accuracy of the aircraft engine with four different scenarios has been improved by 10.17%, 24.97%, 3.25%, and 13.03% about the index root mean squared error, respectively. Similarly, the estimation accuracy of the milling machine has been improved by 23.57% compared to LSTM and 19.54% compared to CapsNet.",NO_AFFILIATIONS,"Yan Qin, Chau Yuen, Yimin Shao, Bo Qin, Xiaoli Li, ",IEEE transactions on cybernetics,NO_DATE,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35468074

79,Safety Profile of Slit-Lamp-Delivered Retinal Laser Photobiomodulation,"Purpose:
        
      
      Photobiomodulation (PBM) refers to therapeutic irradiation of tissue with low-energy, 630- to 1000-nm wavelength light. An increasing body of evidence supports a beneficial effect of PBM in retinal disorders. To date, most studies have utilized light-emitting diode irradiation sources. Slit-lamp-mounted retinal lasers produce a coherent beam that can be delivered with precisely defined dosages and predetermined target area; however, the use of retinal lasers raises safety concerns that warrant investigation prior to clinical application. In this study, we determined safe dosages of laser-delivered PBM to the retina. Methods:
        
      
      A custom-designed, slit-lamp-delivered, 670-nm, red/near-infrared laser was used to administer a range of irradiances to healthy pigmented and non-pigmented rat retinas. The effects of PBM on various functional and structural parameters of the retina were evaluated utilizing a combination of electroretinography, Spectral Domain Optical Coherence (SD-OCT), fluorescein angiography, histology and immunohistochemistry. Results:
        
      
      In non-pigmented rats, no adverse events were identified at any irradiances up to 500 mW/cm2. In pigmented rats, no adverse events were identified at irradiances of 25 or 100 mW/cm2; however, approximately one-third of rats that received 500 mW/cm2 displayed very localized photoreceptor damage in the peripapillary region, typically adjacent to the optic nerve head. Conclusions:
        
      
      A safety threshold exists for laser-delivered PBM in pigmented retinas and was identified as 500 mW/cm2 irradiance; therefore, caution should be exercised in the dosage of laser-delivered PBM administered to pigmented retinas. Translational relevance:

80,A Novel LiDAR Data Classification Algorithm Combined CapsNet with ResNet,"LiDAR data contain feature information such as the height and shape of the ground target and play an important role for land classification. The effect of convolutional neural network (CNN) for feature extraction on LiDAR data is very significant, however CNN cannot resolve the spatial relationship of features adequately. The capsule network (CapsNet) can identify the spatial variations of features and is widely used in supervised learning. In this article, the CapsNet is combined with the residual network (ResNet) to design a deep network-ResCapNet for improving the accuracy of LiDAR classification. The capsule network represents the features by vectors, which can account for the direction of the features and the relative position between the features. Therefore, more detailed feature information can be extracted. ResNet protects the integrity of information by passing input information to the output directly, which can solve the problem of network degradation caused by information loss in the traditional CNN propagation process to a certain extent.

82,Electrophysiological investigation of intact retina with soft printed organic neural interface,"Objective.Understanding how the retina converts a natural image or an electrically stimulated one into neural firing patterns is the focus of on-going research activities.Ex vivo, the retina can be readily investigated using multi electrode arrays (MEAs). However, MEA recording and stimulation from an intact retina (in the eye) has been so far insufficient.Approach.In the present study, we report new soft carbon electrode arrays suitable for recording and stimulating neural activity in an intact retina. Screen-printing of carbon ink on 20µm polyurethane (PU) film was used to realize electrode arrays with electrodes as small as 40µm in diameter. Passivation was achieved with a holey membrane, realized using laser drilling in a thin (50µm) PU film. Plasma polymerized 3.4-ethylenedioxythiophene was used to coat the electrode array to improve the electrode specific capacitance. Chick retinas, embryonic stage day 13, both explanted and intact inside an enucleated eye, were used.Main results.A novel fabrication process based on printed carbon electrodes was developed and yielded high capacitance electrodes on a soft substrate.Ex vivoelectrical recording of retina activity with carbon electrodes is demonstrated. With the addition of organic photo-capacitors, simultaneous photo-electrical stimulation and electrical recording was achieved. Finally, electrical activity recordings from an intact chick retina (inside enucleated eyes) were demonstrated. Both photosensitive retinal ganglion cell responses and spontaneous retina waves were recorded and their features analyzed.Significance.Results of this study demonstrated soft electrode arrays with unique properties, suitable for simultaneous recording and photo-electrical stimulation of the retina at high fidelity.

83,TongueCaps: An Improved Capsule Network Model for Multi-Classification of Tongue Color,"Tongue color is an important part of tongue diagnosis. The change of tongue color is affected by pathological state of body, blood rheology, and other factors. Therefore, physicians can understand a patient's condition by observing tongue color. Currently, most studies use machine learning, which is time consuming and labor intensive. Other studies use deep learning based on convolutional neural network (CNN), but the affine transformation of CNN is less robust and easily loses the spatial relationship between features. Recently, Capsule Networks (CapsNet) have been proposed to overcome these problems. In our work, CapsNet is used for tongue color research for the first time, and improved model TongueCaps is proposed, which combines the advantage of CapsNet and residual block structure to achieve end to end tongue color classification. We conduct experiments on 1371 tongue images; TongueCaps achieve accuracy is 0.8456, sensitivity is 0.8474, and specificity is 0.9586. In addition, the size of TongueCaps is 8.11 M, and FLOPs is 1,335,342, which are smaller than CNN in comparison models. Experiments have confirmed that the CapsNet can be used for tongue color research, and improved model TongueCaps, in this paper, is superior to other comparison models in terms of accuracy, specificity and sensitivity, computational complexity, and size of model.","['1 School of Communication and Information Engineering, Shanghai University, Shanghai 200444, China.', '2 School of Life Science, Shanghai University, Shanghai 200444, China.']","Jinghong Ni, Zhuangzhi Yan, Jiehui Jiang, ","Diagnostics (Basel, Switzerland)",2022,capsule network; deep learning; tongue color.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35328206
84,Classification of colorectal tissue images from high throughput tissue microarrays by ensemble deep learning methods,"Tissue microarray (TMA) core images are a treasure trove for artificial intelligence applications. However, a common problem of TMAs is multiple sectioning, which can change the content of the intended tissue core and requires re-labelling. Here, we investigate different ensemble methods for colorectal tissue classification using high-throughput TMAs. Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) core images of 0.6 mm or 1.0 mm diameter from three international cohorts were extracted from 54 digital slides (n = 15,150 cores). After TMA core extraction and color enhancement, five different flows of independent and ensemble deep learning were applied. Training and testing data with 2144 and 13,006 cores included three classes: tumor, normal or ""other"" tissue. Ground-truth data were collected from 30 ngTMA slides (n = 8689 cores). A test augmentation is applied to reduce the uncertain prediction. Predictive accuracy of the best method, namely Soft Voting Ensemble of one VGG and one CapsNet models was 0.982, 0.947 and 0.939 for normal, ""other"" and tumor, which outperformed to independent or ensemble learning with one base-estimator. Our high-accuracy algorithm for colorectal tissue classification in high-throughput TMAs is amenable to images from different institutions, core sizes and stain intensity. It helps to reduce error in TMA core evaluations with previously given labels.","['1 Institute of Pathology, University of Bern, Murtenstrasse 31, 3008, Bern, Switzerland.', '2 Institute of Pathology, Triemli City Hospital, Birmensdorferstrasse 497, 8063, Zurich, Switzerland.', '3 Institute of Pathology, University of Bern, Murtenstrasse 31, 3008, Bern, Switzerland. inti.zlobec@pathology.unibe.ch.']","Huu-Giao Nguyen, Annika Blank, Heather E Dawson, Alessandro Lugli, Inti Zlobec, ",Scientific reports,2021,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33504830
85,Feature Correlation-Steered Capsule Network for object detection,"Despite Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) based approaches have been successful in objects detection, they predominantly focus on positioning discriminative regions while overlooking the internal holistic part-whole associations within objects. This would ultimately lead to the neglect of feature relationships between object and its parts as well as among those parts, both of which are significantly helpful for detecting discriminative parts. In this paper, we propose to ""look insider the objects"" by digging into part-whole feature correlations and take the attempts to leverage those correlations endowed by the Capsule Network (CapsNet) for robust object detection. Actually, highly correlated capsules across adjacent layers share high familiarity, which will be more likely to be routed together. In light of this, we take such correlations between different capsules of the preceding training samples as an awareness to constrain the subsequent candidate voting scope during the routing procedure, and a Feature Correlation-Steered CapsNet (FCS-CapsNet) with Locally-Constrained Expectation-Maximum (EM) Routing Agreement (LCEMRA) is proposed. Different from conventional EM routing, LCEMRA stipulates that only those relevant low-level capsules (parts) meeting the requirement of quantified intra-object cohesiveness can be clustered to make up high-level capsules (objects). In doing so, part-object associations can be dug by transformation weighting matrixes between capsules layers during such ""part backtracking"" procedure. LCEMRA enables low-level capsules to selectively gather projections from a non-spatially-fixed set of high-level capsules. Experiments on VOC2007, VOC2012, HKU-IS, DUTS, and COCO show that FCS-CapsNet can achieve promising object detection effects across multiple evaluation metrics, which are on-par with state-of-the-arts.","['1 College of Information and Electrical Engineering, China Agricultural University, Beijing, 100083, China; Key Laboratory of Agricultural Informatization Standardization, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, Beijing, 100083, China.', '2 Key Laboratory of Agricultural Informatization Standardization, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, Beijing, 100083, China.', '3 College of Science, China Agricultural University, Beijing, 100083, China.

86,Monocarboxylate Transporter 1 (MCT1) Mediates Succinate Export in the Retina,"Purpose:
        
      
      Succinate is exported by the retina and imported by eyecup tissue. The transporters mediating this process have not yet been identified. Recent studies showed that monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1) can transport succinate across plasma membranes in cardiac and skeletal muscle. Retina and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) both express multiple MCT isoforms including MCT1. We tested the hypothesis that MCTs facilitate retinal succinate export and RPE succinate import. Methods:
        
      
      We assessed retinal succinate export and eyecup succinate import in short-term ex vivo culture using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. We tested the dependence of succinate export and import on pH, proton ionophores, conventional MCT substrates, and the MCT inhibitors AZD3965, AR-C155858, and diclofenac. Results:
        
      
      Succinate exits retinal tissue through MCT1 but does not enter the RPE through MCT1 or any other MCT. Intracellular succinate levels are a contributing factor that determines if an MCT1-expressing tissue will export succinate. Conclusions:
        
      
      MCT1 facilitates export of succinate from retinas. An unidentified, non-MCT transporter facilitates import of succinate into RPE.","['1 Department of Biochemistry, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, United States.', ""2 Center for Developmental Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Seattle Children's Research Institute, Seattle, Washington, United States.""]","Celia M Bisbach, Daniel T Hass, Eric D Thomas, Timothy J Cherry, James B Hurley, ",Investigative ophthalmology & visual science,2022,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35363247
87,Convolutional capsule network for COVID-19 detection using radiography images,"Novel corona virus COVID-19 has spread rapidly all over the world. Due to increasing COVID-19 cases, there is a dearth of testing kits. Therefore, there is a severe need for an automatic recognition system as a solution to reduce the spreading of the COVID-19 virus. This work offers a decision support system based on the X-ray image to diagnose the presence of the COVID-19 virus. A deep learning-based computer-aided decision support system will be capable to differentiate between COVID-19 and pneumonia. Recently, convolutional neural network (CNN) is designed for the diagnosis of COVID-19 patients through chest radiography (or chest X-ray, CXR) images. However, due to the usage of CNN, there are some limitations with these decision support systems. These systems suffer with the problem of view-invariance and loss of information due to down-sampling. In this paper, the capsule network (CapsNet)-based system named visual geometry group capsule network (VGG-CapsNet) for the diagnosis of COVID-19 is proposed. Due to the usage of capsule network (CapsNet), the authors have succeeded in removing the drawbacks found in the CNN-based decision support system for the detection of COVID-19. Through simulation results, it is found that VGG-CapsNet has performed better than the CNN-CapsNet model for the diagnosis of COVID-19. The proposed VGG-CapsNet-based system has shown 97% accuracy for COVID-19 versus non-COVID-19 classification, and 92% accuracy for COVID-19 versus normal versus viral pneumonia classification. Proposed VGG-CapsNet-based system available at https://github.com/shamiktiwari/COVID19_Xray can be used to detect the existence of COVID-19 virus in the human body through chest radiographic images.","['1 Department of Virtualization, School of Computer Science University of Petroleum and Energy Studies Dehradun Uttarakhand India.']","Shamik Tiwari, Anurag Jain, ",International journal of imaging systems and technology,NO_DATE,COVID‐19; X‐ray; capsule network; convolutional neural network; decision support system; deep learning; visual geometry group.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33821095
88,Two-dimensional mathematical modelling of retinal oxygen transport and recommending treatment options,"This paper presents a novel two-dimensional (2D) computational modeling of the retinal oxygen delivery, transport, and consumption analysis. The 2D modeling allows the division of the retina into four layers to address different flow profiles. The retina domain was meshed using the ICEM CFD mesher, while the ANSYS Fluent was used to calculate the transport phenomena for the four different layers. Clinical cases such as diabetes and sickle cell anaemia denoting the effects of decreasing retinal blood flow and hemoglobin's oxygen affinity were investigated. The simulation results showed that for a healthy retina in light and dark conditions, the outer retina is in danger of hypoxia at thickness >197.56μm. However, the treatment of severe ischaemia using extreme hyperoxia seems beneficial for retinal thickness >197.56μm but harmful for thickness <122.75μm. The reduction of hemoglobin's oxygen affinity at low blood flow regimes could not improve the retina's oxygen levels. The study supports the oxygen toxicity hypothesis that hypoxia causes retina degeneration and estimates the retinal thickness and lighting conditions (dark or light) this may occur.","['1 Imperial College London, Department of Chemical Engineering, London, United Kingdom.', '2 School of Physical Sciences, Department of Chemistry, Cape Coast, Ghana.']","Grace Esu-Ejemot Aquah, Foster Kwame Kholi, Samuel Kofi Tulashie, ",Biomedical physics & engineering express,2021,computational fluid dynamics; hypoxia; oxygen transport; pathological conditions; retinopathy; two-dimensional computational modelling.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34438370

      To use multimodal retinal images (including quantitative fundus autofluorescence [QAF]) for spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT)-based image registration and alignment. For each age decade of healthy adults, normative fine-grained QAF retinal maps are generated and advanced methods for QAF image analysis are applied. Methods:
        
      
      Multimodal retinal images were obtained from 103 healthy subjects (age 19-77 years; unremarkable retina/macula, age-appropriate clear optic media). Custom written FIJI plugins enabled: (1) determination of the fovea in SD-OCT and the edge of the optic disc in infrared (IR) images; (2) alignment and superimposition of multimodal retinal images based on foveal and optic disc position; (3) plotting of normative QAF retinal maps for each decade; and (4) comparison of individual retinas with normative retinas of different decades using newly introduced analysis patterns (QAF97, freehand tool). Results:
        
      
      SD-OCT based image registration enables easy image registration, alignment, and analysis of different modalities (QAF, IR, and SD-OCT here reported). In QAF, intensities significantly increase with age with two major inclines between the third/fourth and seventh/eighth decades. With aging, the parafoveal area of maximum QAF intensity slightly shifts from temporal-superior to temporal. Compared with standard QAF analysis, refined QAF analysis patterns reveal a more detailed analysis of QAF, especially in the diseased retina. Conclusions:
        
      
      Age-related QAF normative retinal maps can be used to directly compare and classify individual's QAF intensities. Advanced QAF analysis tools will further help to interpret autofluorescence changes in normal aging and in the diseased retina in a multimodal imaging setting.

90,Diagnosis of anomalies based on hybrid features extraction in thyroid images,"Diagnosing benign and malignant glands in thyroid ultrasound images is considered a challenging issue. Recently, deep learning techniques have significantly resulted in extracting features from medical images and classifying them. Convolutional neural networks ignore the hierarchical structure of entities within images and do not pay attention to spatial information as well as the need for a large number of training samples. Capsule networks consist of different hierarchical capsules equivalent to the same layers in the convolutional neural networks. We propose a feature extraction method for ultrasound images based on the capsule network. Then, we combine those deep features with conventional features such as Histogram of Oriented Gradients and Local Binary Pattern together to form a hybrid feature space. We increase the accuracy percentage of a support vector machine (SVM) by balancing and reducing the data dimensions of samples. Since the SVM provides different training kernels according to the sample distribution method, the extracted textural features were categorized using each of these kernels to obtain the result. The parameters of classification evaluation using the researcher-made model have outperformed the other methods in this field. Experimental results showed that the combination of HOG, LBP, and CapsNet methods outperformed the others, with 83.95% accuracy in the SVM with a linear kernel.","['1 Department of Computer, Ferdows Branch, Islamic Azad University, Ferdows, Iran.']","Mahin Tasnimi, Hamid Reza Ghaffari, ",Multimedia tools and applications,NO_DATE,Capsule network; Deep learning; Histogram of oriented gradients algorithm; Local binary pattern algorithm; Thyroid diagnosis.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35874325

Here, we generate the first human cone photoreceptor reporter cell line by CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing of a human embryonic stem cell (hESC) line to tag both alleles of the Guanine nucleotide-binding protein subunit gamma-T2 (GNGT2) gene with a mCherry reporter cassette. Three-dimensional optic vesicle-like structures were produced to verify reporter fidelity and track cones throughout their development in culture. The GNGT2-T2A-mCherry hESC line faithfully and robustly labels GNGT2-expressing cones throughout the entirety of their differentiation in vitro, recapitulating normal fetal expression of this gene. Our observations indicate that human cones undergo significant migratory activity during the course of differentiation in vitro. Consistent with this, our analysis of human fetal retinae from different stages of development finds positional differences of the cone population depending on their state of maturation. This novel reporter line will provide a useful tool for investigating human cone development and disease.","['1 Clinical and Experimental Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK.', '2 Wessex Regional Genetics Laboratory, Salisbury District Hospital, Salisbury, UK.', '3 UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London and NIHR Great Ormond Street Hospital Biomedical Research Centre, London, UK.']","Liliya Nazlamova, Emma-Jane Cassidy, Jane C Sowden, Andrew Lotery, Jörn Lakowski, ","Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)",2022,GNGT2; cone photoreceptor; optic vesicles; retinal organoids; stem cells.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35293574
92,Delineating the role of eIF2α in retinal degeneration,"Activation of the unfolded protein response has been detected in various animal models of retinal degeneration. The PERK branch converges on eIF2α to regulate protein synthesis. We previously reported that diseased retinas produce less protein as they degenerate. We also proposed that the majority of this reduction in protein synthesis may not be due to control of eIF2α. Nevertheless, multiple research groups have reported that modulating eIF2α levels may be a viable strategy in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. Here, using two genetic approaches, a systemic Gadd34 knockout and a photoreceptor conditional Perk knockout, to alter p-eIF2α levels in rd16 mice, we demonstrate not only that degenerating retinas may not use this mechanism to signal for a decline in protein synthesis rates but also that modulation of p-eIF2α levels is insufficient to delay retinal degeneration.","['1 Department of Optometry and Vision Science, The University of Alabama at Birmingham, School of Optometry, Birmingham, AL, USA.', '2 Department of Optometry and Vision Science, The University of Alabama at Birmingham, School of Optometry, Birmingham, AL, USA. mgortk@uab.edu.']","Christopher R Starr, Marina S Gorbatyuk, ",Cell death & disease,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31138784

We probed neural code variation using ∼100 population recordings from major ganglion cell types in the macaque retina, combined with an interpretable computational representation of individual variability. This representation captured variation and covariation in properties such as nonlinearity, temporal dynamics, and spatial receptive field size and preserved invariances such as asymmetries between On and Off cells. The covariation of response properties in different cell types was associated with the proximity of lamination of their synaptic input. Surprisingly, male retinas exhibited higher firing rates and faster temporal integration than female retinas. Exploiting data from previously recorded retinas enabled efficient characterization of a new macaque retina, and of a human retina. Simulations indicated that combining a large dataset of retinal recordings with behavioral feedback could reveal the neural code in a living human and thus improve vision restoration with retinal implants.","['1 Department of Electrical Engineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA; Hansen Experimental Physics Lab, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA; Department of Neurosurgery, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.

In both cases there are reports for the presence of markers of lipid peroxidation in retinal cells. We investigated if nitrosative stress also occurs in the human retina with aging. We examined the cellular localization of nitro-tyrosine, a biomarker of protein tyrosine nitration, in human donor retina (17-91 years; N = 15) by immunohistochemistry. Immunoreactivity (IR) to nitro-tyrosine was present in ten retinas and absent in five retinas. It was predominant in photoreceptor inner segments, cell bodies and axons. In six retinas, IR was present in abnormal, swollen axons of macular and peripheral cones. In the inner retina, weak immunoreactivity was detected in the outer and inner plexiform layer. Transmission electron microscopy revealed a variable degree of microtubule disorganization, abnormal outgrowth from the swollen macular axons (as the fibers of Henle) and few dead axons. The present study adds further evidence to the presence of aberrant photoreceptor axonal changes in the human retina and that nitro-tyrosine immunoreactivity is associated with the photoreceptor cells in select human retina.","['1 Department of Anatomy, Neurobiology Laboratory, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, 110029, India.

95,Multitask CapsNet: An Imbalanced Data Deep Learning Method for Predicting Toxicants,"Drug development has a high failure rate, with safety properties constituting a considerable challenge. To reduce risk, in silico tools, including various machine learning methods, have been applied for toxicity prediction. However, these approaches often confront a serious problem: the training data sets are usually biased (imbalanced positive and negative samples), which would result in model training difficulty and unsatisfactory prediction accuracy. Multitask networks obtained significantly better predictive accuracies than single-task methods, and capsule neural networks showed excellent performance in sparse data sets in previous studies. In this study, we developed a new multitask framework based on a capsule neural network (multitask CapsNet) to measure 12 different toxic effects simultaneously. We found that multitask CapsNet excelled in toxicity prediction and outperformed many other computational approaches using the multitask strategy. Only after training on biased data sets did multitask CapsNet achieve significantly improved prediction accuracy on the Tox21 Data Challenge, which gave the largest ratio of highest accuracy (8/12) among compared models. Our model gave a prediction accuracy of 96.6% for the target NR.PPAR.gamma, whose ratio of negative to positive samples was up to 36:1.

However, the conventional methods ignore the spatial characteristics of EEG signals, which also contain salient information related to emotion states. In this paper, a deep learning framework based on a multiband feature matrix (MFM) and a capsule network (CapsNet) is proposed. In the framework, the frequency domain, spatial characteristics, and frequency band characteristics of the multi-channel EEG signals are combined to construct the MFM. Then, the CapsNet model is introduced to recognize emotion states according to the input MFM. Experiments conducted on the dataset for emotion analysis using EEG, physiological, and video signals (DEAP) indicate that the proposed method outperforms most of the common models.

By 2025, the number of elderly patients with AD aged 65 and over will reach 7.1 million, an increase of nearly 29% over the 5.5 million patients of the same age in 2018. Unless medical breakthroughs are made, AD patients may increase from 5.5 million to 13.8 million by 2050, almost three times the original. Researchers have focused on developing complex machine learning (ML) algorithms, i.e., convolutional neural networks (CNNs), containing millions of parameters. However, CNN models need many training samples. A small number of training samples in CNN models may lead to overfitting problems. With the continuous research of CNN, other networks have been proposed, such as randomized neural networks (RNNs). Schmidt neural network (SNN), random vector functional link (RVFL), and extreme learning machine (ELM) are three types of RNNs. Methods: We propose three novel models to classify brain diseases to cope with these problems. The proposed models are DenseNet-based SNN (DSNN), DenseNet-based RVFL (DRVFL), and DenseNet-based ELM (DELM). The backbone of the three proposed models is the pre-trained ""customize"" DenseNet. The modified DenseNet is fine-tuned on the empirical dataset. Finally, the last five layers of the fine-tuned DenseNet are substituted by SNN, ELM, and RVFL, respectively. Results: Overall, the DSNN gets the best performance among the three proposed models in classification performance. We evaluate the proposed DSNN by five-fold cross-validation. The accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, and F1-score of the proposed DSNN on the test set are 98.46% ± 2.05%, 100.00% ± 0.00%, 85.00% ± 20.00%, 98.36% ± 2.17%, and 99.16% ± 1.11%, respectively. The proposed DSNN is compared with restricted DenseNet, spiking neural network, and other state-of-the-art methods. Finally, our model obtains the best results among all models. Conclusions: DSNN is an effective model for classifying brain diseases.","['1 School of Computing and Mathematical Sciences, University of Leicester, East Midlands, United Kingdom.', '2 School of Computer Science and Technology, Henan Polytechnic University, Jiaozuo, China.', '3 Department of Signal Theory, Networking and Communications, University of Granada, Granada, Spain.', '4 Guangxi Key Laboratory of Trusted Software, Guilin University of Electronic Technology, Guilin, China.']","Ziquan Zhu, Siyuan Lu, Shui-Hua Wang, Juan Manuel Gorriz, Yu-Dong Zhang, ",Frontiers in systems neuroscience,2022,DenseNet; MRI; brain diseases; convolutional neural network; randomized neural network.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35720439
98,Classification of Dental Radiographs Using Deep Learning,"Objectives:
        
      
      To retrospectively assess radiographic data and to prospectively classify radiographs (namely, panoramic, bitewing, periapical, and cephalometric images), we compared three deep learning architectures for their classification performance. Methods:
        
      
      Our dataset consisted of 31,288 panoramic, 43,598 periapical, 14,326 bitewing, and 1176 cephalometric radiographs from two centers (Berlin/Germany; Lucknow/India). For a subset of images L (32,381 images), image classifications were available and manually validated by an expert. The remaining subset of images U was iteratively annotated using active learning, with ResNet-34 being trained on L, least confidence informative sampling being performed on U, and the most uncertain image classifications from U being reviewed by a human expert and iteratively used for re-training. We then employed a baseline convolutional neural networks (CNN), a residual network (another ResNet-34, pretrained on ImageNet), and a capsule network (CapsNet) for classification. Early stopping was used to prevent overfitting. Evaluation of the model performances followed stratified k-fold cross-validation. Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) was used to provide visualizations of the weighted activations maps. Results:
        
      
      All three models showed high accuracy (>98%) with significantly higher accuracy, F1-score, precision, and sensitivity of ResNet than baseline CNN and CapsNet (p < 0.05). Specificity was not significantly different. ResNet achieved the best performance at small variance and fastest convergence. Misclassification was most common between bitewings and periapicals. For bitewings, model activation was most notable in the inter-arch space for periapicals interdentally, for panoramics on bony structures of maxilla and mandible, and for cephalometrics on the viscerocranium. Conclusions:
        
      
      Regardless of the models, high classification accuracies were achieved. Image features considered for classification were consistent with expert reasoning.","['1 Department of Oral Diagnostics, Digital Health and Health Services Research, Charité-Universitätsmedizin Berlin, 14197 Berlin, Germany.', '2 ITU/WHO Focus Group AI on Health, Topic Group Dentistry, 1211 Geneva, Switzerland.', ""3 Department of Oral Medicine and Radiology, King George's Medical University, Lucknow 226003, Uttar Pradesh, India.""]","Jose E Cejudo, Akhilanand Chaurasia, Ben Feldberg, Joachim Krois, Falk Schwendicke, ",Journal of clinical medicine,2021,artificial intelligence; classification deep learning; dental; machine learning; radiographs; teeth.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33916800

100,Deep Vascular Imaging in the Eye with Flow-Enhanced Ultrasound,"The retina within the eye is one of the most energy-demanding tissues in the body and thus requires high rates of oxygen delivery from a rich blood supply. The capillary lamina of the choroid lines the outer surface of the retina and is the dominating source of oxygen in most vertebrate retinas. However, this vascular bed is challenging to image with traditional optical techniques due to its position behind the highly light-absorbing retina. Here we describe a high-frequency ultrasound technique with subsequent flow-enhancement to image deep vascular beds (0.5-3 cm) of the eye with a high spatiotemporal resolution. This non-invasive method works well in species with nucleated red blood cells (non-mammalian and fetal animal models). It allows for the generation of non-invasive three-dimensional angiographies without the use of contrast agents, and it is independent of blood flow angles with a higher sensitivity than Doppler-based ultrasound imaging techniques.","['1 Aarhus Institute of Advanced Studies, Aarhus University; Zoophysiology, Department of Biology, Aarhus University.', '2 Department of Clinical Medicine, Aarhus University; henrik@clin.au.dk.']","Christian Damsgaard, Henrik Lauridsen, ",Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,2021,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34661576
101,Asymmetrical influence of a standard light/dark cycle and constant light conditions on the alanyl-aminopeptidase activity of the left and right retinas in adult male rats,"The retina acts as an independent clock informing the central pacemaker, the suprachiasmatic nucleus, under environmental light conditions, with consequences of such inputs for the central and peripheral nervous system. Differences in the behavior of the left and right retinas depending on environmental light conditions may influence the information projected to the brain hemispheres. The retina possesses neuropeptides that act as neurotransmitters or neuromodulators. Alanyl-aminopeptidase (AlaAP, EC 3.4.11.2) activity regulates some of these neuropeptides and therefore reflects their function. We analyzed AlaAP activity in the left and right retinas of adult male rats at successive time points under standard (12/12 h light/dark cycle) and nonstandard (constant light) conditions. AlaAP activity was measured fluorometrically using alanyl-beta-naphthylamide as the substrate. Under standard conditions, there were no differences in the left or right retina between time points, with the left retina predominating, particularly in the light period. In contrast, under constant light, no left versus right differences were observed, but significant differences between time points appeared. In comparison with standard conditions, constant conditions led to significantly higher AlaAP activity. Considering all the left retina data in comparison with all the right retina data, no correlation was found between the left and right retinas under standard conditions, but a significant positive correlation was observed under constant light. These results demonstrate an asymmetrical response of retinal AlaAP activity to changes in environmental light conditions, which may affect the functions in which the substrates of AlaAP are involved and the information projected to the brain hemispheres.","['1 Department of Health Sciences, University of Jaén, 23071, Jaén, Spain; Department of Physiology, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Granada (Ceuta Campus), 18016, Granada, Spain.', '2 Department of Health Sciences, University of Jaén, 23071, Jaén, Spain; Department of Physiology, Medical School, University of the Basque Country, 48080, Leioa, Spain.', '3 Department of Health Sciences, University of Jaén, 23071, Jaén, Spain.', '4 Department of Biostatistics, Medical School, University of Granada, 18016, Granada, Spain.', '5 Department of Health Sciences, University of Jaén, 23071, Jaén, Spain; Department of Physiology, Medical School, University of the Basque Country, 48080, Leioa, Spain.

102,Bi-CapsNet: A Binary Capsule Network for EEG-based Emotion Recognition,"In recent years, deep learning has gained widespread attention in electroencephalogram (EEG)-based emotion recognition. However, deep learning methods are usually time-consuming with a large amount of memory usage, which obstructs their practical usage on resource-constrained devices. In this paper, we propose a binary capsule network (Bi-CapsNet) for EEG emotion recognition with low computational cost and memory usage. The Bi-CapsNet binarizes 32-bit weights and activations to 1 bit, and replaces floating-point operations with efficient bitwise operations. To address the issue of function discontinuity in backward propagation, we use a continuous function to approximate the binarization process. Two popular EEG emotion databases, namely, DEAP and DREAMER, are used for performance evaluation. In comparison to its full-precision counterpart, the Bi-CapsNet achieves a reduction on the computational cost and a reduction on the memory usage, while with only a 1% drop on the recognition accuracy. Compared to some state-of-the-art EEG emotion recognition methods, the proposed method obtains more competitive performance. In addition, the Bi-CapsNet is implemented on a mobile phone via an open-source binary inference framework named Bolt, and it achieves an ∼ 5× inference acceleration in comparison to its full-precision counterpart.",NO_AFFILIATIONS,"Yu Liu, Yi Wei, Chang Li, Juan Cheng, Rencheng Song, Xun Chen, ",IEEE journal of biomedical and health informatics,2022,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37015506
103,Hyperspectral Image Classification with Capsule Network Using Limited Training Samples,"Deep learning techniques have boosted the performance of hyperspectral image (HSI) classification. In particular, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown superior performance to that of the conventional machine learning algorithms. Recently, a novel type of neural networks called capsule networks (CapsNets) was presented to improve the most advanced CNNs. In this paper, we present a modified two-layer CapsNet with limited training samples for HSI classification, which is inspired by the comparability and simplicity of the shallower deep learning models. The presented CapsNet is trained using two real HSI datasets, i.e., the PaviaU (PU) and SalinasA datasets, representing complex and simple datasets, respectively, and which are used to investigate the robustness or representation of every model or classifier. In addition, a comparable paradigm of network architecture design has been proposed for the comparison of CNN and CapsNet. Experiments demonstrate that CapsNet shows better accuracy and convergence behavior for the complex data than the state-of-the-art CNN. For CapsNet using the PU dataset, the Kappa coefficient, overall accuracy, and average accuracy are 0.9456, 95.90%, and 96.27%, respectively, compared to the corresponding values yielded by CNN of 0.9345, 95.11%, and 95.63%. Moreover, we observed that CapsNet has much higher confidence for the predicted probabilities. Subsequently, this finding was analyzed and discussed with probability maps and uncertainty analysis. In terms of the existing literature, CapsNet provides promising results and explicit merits in comparison with CNN and two baseline classifiers, i.e., random forests (RFs) and support vector machines (SVMs).","['1 School of Geodesy and Geomatics, Wuhan University, Wuhan 430079, China. fdeng@sgg.whu.edu.cn.', '2 School of Geodesy and Geomatics, Wuhan University, Wuhan 430079, China. shengliangpu@163.com.', '3 State Key Laboratory of Earth Surface Processes and Resource Ecology, Beijing Normal University, Beijing 100875, China. cxh1216@gmail.com.', '4 State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of Satellites Remote Sensing, Institute of Remote Sensing and Digital Earth, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China. shiys@radi.ac.cn.', '5 School of Geodesy and Geomatics, Wuhan University, Wuhan 430079, China. ztyuan@whu.edu.cn.', '6 State Key Laboratory of Geohazard Prevention and Geoenvironment Protection, Chengdu University of Technology, Chengdu 610059, China. pushengyan13@cdut.cn.']","Fei Deng, Shengliang Pu, Xuehong Chen, Yusheng Shi, Ting Yuan, Shengyan Pu, ","Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2018,capsule network; deep learning; hyperspectral; image classification; possibility density.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30231574
104,Metabolic signature of the aging eye in mice,"Aging is a major risk factor for age-related ocular diseases including age-related macular degeneration in the retina and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), cataracts in the lens, glaucoma in the optic nerve, and dry eye syndrome in the cornea. We used targeted metabolomics to analyze metabolites from young (6 weeks) and old (73 weeks) eyes in C57 BL6/J mice. Old mice had diminished electroretinogram responses and decreased number of photoreceptors in their retinas. Among the 297 detected metabolites, 45-114 metabolites are significantly altered in aged eye tissues, mostly in the neuronal tissues (retina and optic nerve) and less in cornea, RPE/choroid, and lens. We noted that changes of metabolites in mitochondrial metabolism and glucose metabolism are common features in the aged retina, RPE/choroid, and optic nerve. The aging retina, cornea, and optic nerve also share similar changes in Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD), 1-methylnicotinamides, 3-methylhistidine, and other methylated metabolites. Metabolites in taurine metabolism are strikingly influenced by aging in the cornea and lens. In conclusion, the aging eye has both common and tissue-specific metabolic signatures. These changes may be attributed to dysregulated mitochondrial metabolism, reprogrammed glucose metabolism and impaired methylation in the aging eye. Our findings provide biochemical insights into the mechanisms of age-related ocular changes.","['1 Department of Ophthalmology, West Virginia University, Morgantown, WV, USA; Department of Biochemistry, West Virginia University, Morgantown, WV, USA.', '2 Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Miami University, Oxford, OH, USA.', '3 Department of Ophthalmology, West Virginia University, Morgantown, WV, USA; Department of Biochemistry, West Virginia University, Morgantown, WV, USA.

105,Brain Tumor Segmentation Using Deep Capsule Network and Latent-Dynamic Conditional Random Fields,"Because of the large variabilities in brain tumors, automating segmentation remains a difficult task. We propose an automated method to segment brain tumors by integrating the deep capsule network (CapsNet) and the latent-dynamic condition random field (LDCRF). The method consists of three main processes to segment the brain tumor-pre-processing, segmentation, and post-processing. In pre-processing, the N4ITK process involves correcting each MR image's bias field before normalizing the intensity. After that, image patches are used to train CapsNet during the segmentation process. Then, with the CapsNet parameters determined, we employ image slices from an axial view to learn the LDCRF-CapsNet. Finally, we use a simple thresholding method to correct the labels of some pixels and remove small 3D-connected regions from the segmentation outcomes. On the BRATS 2015 and BRATS 2021 datasets, we trained and evaluated our method and discovered that it outperforms and can compete with state-of-the-art methods in comparable conditions.","['1 Computer Science Department, Faculty of Science, Tanta University, Tanta 31527, Egypt.', '2 College of Computer Science and Engineering, Taibah University, Yanbu 966144, Saudi Arabia.', '3 Faculty of Computers and Information, KafrElSheikh University, Kafr El-Sheikh 32626, Egypt.', '4 Computer Science Department, Faculty of Computers and Informatics, Zagazig University, Zagazig 44511, Egypt.']","Mahmoud Elmezain, Amena Mahmoud, Diana T Mosa, Wael Said, ",Journal of imaging,2022,brain tumor; deep capsule network; latent-dynamic condition random field; medical image segmentation.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35877634
106,Oxidative stress-induced alterations in retinal glucose metabolism in Retinitis Pigmentosa,"Retinitis pigmentosa occurs due to mutations that cause rod photoreceptor degeneration. Once most rods are lost, gradual degeneration of cone photoreceptors occurs. Oxidative damage and abnormal glucose metabolism have been implicated as contributors to cone photoreceptor death. Herein, we show increased phosphorylation of key enzymes of glucose metabolism in the retinas of rd10 mice, a model of RP, and retinas of wild type mice with paraquat-induced oxidative stress, thereby inhibiting these key enzymes. Dietary supplementation with glucose and pyruvate failed to overcome the inhibition, but increased reducing equivalents in the retina and improved cone function and survival. Dichloroacetate reversed the increased phosphorylation of pyruvate dehydrogenase in rd10 retina and increased histone acetylation and levels of TP53-induced glycolysis and apoptosis regulator (TIGAR), which redirected glucose metabolism toward the pentose phosphate pathway. These data indicate that oxidative stress induced damage can be reversed by shifting glycolytic intermediates toward the pentose phosphate pathway which increases reducing equivalents and provides photoreceptor protection.","['1 The Wilmer Eye Institute, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.', '2 The Wilmer Eye Institute, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA; Department of Neuroscience, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.

      Retinal neovascularization is a severe pathological process leading to irreversible blindness. This study aims to identify the altered metabolites and their related pathways that are involved in retinal neovascularization. Methods:
        
      
      To reveal the global metabolomic profile change in the retinal neovascularization process, an untargeted metabolomics analysis of oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) mice retinas was carried out first, followed by the validation of amino acids and their derivatives through a targeted metabolomics analysis. The involved pathways were predicted by bioinformatic analysis. Results:
        
      
      By untargeted metabolomics, a total of 58 and 49 metabolites altered significantly in OIR retinas under cationic and anionic modes, respectively. By bioinformatics analysis, ""ABC transporters,"" ""central carbon metabolism in cancer."" and ""alanine, aspartate, and glutamate metabolism"" were the most enriched Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways associated with the changed metabolites. By targeted metabolomics, no significant change was found in the assessed amino acids and their derivatives at postnatal day (P) 12, whereas significantly altered amino acids and their derivatives were recognized at P13, P17, and P42 in OIR retinas. Conclusions:
        
      
      The metabolomic profile was significantly altered in the neovascularized retinas. In particular, numerous amino acids and their derivatives were significantly changed in OIR retinas. These altered metabolites, together with their associated pathways, might be involved in the pathogenesis of retinal neovascular diseases.","['1 Department of Ophthalmology, The Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, China.', '2 Hunan Clinical Research Center of Ophthalmic Disease, Changsha, Hunan, China.', '3 Department of Ophthalmology, Kurume University School of Medicine, Kurume, Fukuoka, Japan.']","Yedi Zhou, Wei Tan, Jingling Zou, Jian Cao, Qian Huang, Bing Jiang, Shigeo Yoshida, Yun Li, ",Investigative ophthalmology & visual science,2021,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34374743

The human eyeball requires the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) to interface the neural retina and the choroid at large. Millions of people suffer from age-related macular degeneration (AMD), a blinding multifactor genetic disease among RPE degradation pathologies. Recently, autologous pluripotent stem-cell-derived RPE cells were prohibitively expensive due to time; therefore, we developed a faster reprogramming system. We stably induced RPE-like cells (iRPE) from human fibroblasts (Fibs) by conditional overexpression of both broad plasticity and lineage-specific transcription factors (TFs). iRPE cells displayed critical RPE benchmarks and significant in vivo integration in transplanted retinas. Herein, we detail the iRPE system with comprehensive single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) profiling to interpret and characterize its best cells. We anticipate that our system may enable robust retinal cell induction for basic research and affordable autologous human RPE tissue for regenerative cell therapy.","['1 RIKEN Center for Biosystems Dynamics Research, Kobe 650-0047, Japan.', '2 RIKEN Center for Integrative Medical Sciences, Yokohama 230-0045, Japan.', '3 RIKEN Center for Biosystems Dynamics Research, Kobe 650-0047, Japan; Laboratory of Molecular Cell Biology and Development, Department of Animal Development and Physiology, Graduate School of Biostudies, Kyoto University, Kyoto 606-8501, Japan; Department of Renal and Cardiovascular Research, New Drug Research Division, Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co.

We used mouse retinal explant cultures and shRNA to investigate the roles of Setd2 and Setd5, which encode H3K36me3 methyltransferases, in retinal development. We found that shSetd5 caused abnormal retinal structures and reduced rods and Müller cells, whereas shSetd2 did not cause any abnormalities. The mutant SETD5 lacking the SET domain failed to reverse the phenotypes observed in the shSetd5-expressing retinas, while SETD5S1257*, which does not interact with HDAC3 and PAF1 complexes, rescued proliferation, but not apoptosis, induced by shSetd5. Taken together, we found that Setd5, but not Setd2, is essential for sustaining retinal cell survival and proliferation, and the SET domain of SETD5 is pivotal for both functions.","['1 Division of Molecular and Developmental Biology, Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo, Japan.', '2 Department of Retinal Biology and Pathology, University of Tokyo Hospital, University of Tokyo, Japan.']","Toshiro Iwagawa, Ryoko Kawabata, Masaya Fukushima, Hiroshi Kuribayashi, Sumiko Watanabe, ",FEBS letters,NO_DATE,H3K36me3; Setd2; Setd5; retinal development.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36349512
110,Neuromodulation using electroosmosis,"Objective.Our laboratory has proposed chemical stimulation of retinal neurons using exogenous glutamate as a biomimetic strategy for treating vision loss caused by photoreceptor (PR) degenerative diseases. Although our previousin-vitrostudies using pneumatic actuation indicate that chemical retinal stimulation is achievable, an actuation technology that is amenable to microfabrication, as needed for anin-vivoimplantable device, has yet to be realized. In this study, we sought to evaluate electroosmotic flow (EOF) as a mechanism for delivering small quantities of glutamate to the retina. EOF has great potential for miniaturization.Approach.An EOF device to dispense small quantities of glutamate was constructed and its ability to drive retinal output tested in anin-vitropreparation of PR degenerate rat retina.Main results.We built and tested an EOF microfluidic system, with 3D printed and off-the-shelf components, capable of injecting small volumes of glutamate in a pulsatile fashion when a low voltage control signal was applied. With this device, we produced excitatory and inhibitory spike rate responses in PR degenerate rat retinae. Glutamate evoked spike rate responses were also observed to be voltage-dependent and localized to the site of injection.Significance.The EOF device performed similarly to a previously tested conventional pneumatic microinjector as a means of chemically stimulating the retina while eliminating the moving plunger of the pneumatic microinjector that would be difficult to miniaturize and parallelize. Although not implantable, the prototype device presented here as a proof of concept indicates that a retinal prosthetic based on EOF-driven chemical stimulation is a viable and worthwhile goal. EOF should have similar advantages for controlled dispensing of charged neurochemicals at any neural interface.","['1 Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL, United States of America.', '2 Department of Biomedical Engineering, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, United States of America.']","Sai Siva Kare, Corey M Rountree, John B Troy, John D Finan, Laxman Saggere, ",Journal of neural engineering,2021,chemical retinal stimulation; electroosmotic flow; neural interface; photoreceptor degenerative diseases; pneumatic actuation; retinal prostheses.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33984848
111,Spatial Organization and Dynamics of the Extracellular Space in the Mouse Retina,"The extracellular space (ECS) plays an important role in the physiology of neural circuits. Despite our detailed understanding of the cellular architecture of the mammalian retina, little is known about the organization and dynamics of the retinal ECS. We developed an optical technique based on two-photon imaging of fluorescently labeled extracellular fluid to measure the ECS volume fraction (α) in the ex vivo retina of male and female mice. This method has high spatial resolution and can detect rapid changes in α evoked by osmotic challenge and neuronal activity. The measured ECS α varied dramatically in different layers of the adult mouse retina, with α equaling ∼0.050 in the ganglion cell layer, ∼0.122 in the inner plexiform layer (IPL), ∼0.025 in the inner nuclear layer (INL), ∼0.087 in the outer plexiform layer, and ∼0.026 in the outer nuclear layer (ONL). ECS α was significantly larger early in retinal development; α was 67% larger in the IPL and 100% larger in the INL in neonatal mice compared with adults. In adult retinas, light stimulation evoked rapid decreases in ECS α. Light-driven reductions in ECS α were largest in the IPL, where visual stimuli decreased α values ∼10%. These light-evoked decreases demonstrate that a physiological stimulus can lead to rapid changes in ECS α and indicate that activity-dependent regulation of extracellular space may contribute to visual processing in the retina.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The volume fraction of the extracellular space (ECS α), that portion of CNS tissue occupied by interstitial space, influences the diffusion of neurotransmitters from the synaptic cleft and the volume transmission of transmitters. However, ECS α has never been measured in live retina, and little is known about how ECS α varies following physiological stimulation. Here we show that ECS α values vary dramatically between different retinal layers and decrease by 10% following light stimulation. ECS α differences within the retina will influence volume transmission and light-evoked α variations may modulate synaptic transmission and visual processing in the retina. Activity-dependent ECS α variations may represent a mechanism of synaptic modulation throughout the CNS.","['1 Department of Neuroscience, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455.', '2 Department of Neuroscience, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455 ean@umn.edu.']","Sidney P Kuo, Pei-Pei Chiang, Amy R Nippert, Eric A Newman, ",The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,2020,diffusion; extracellular space; glial cells; light response; retina; volume fraction.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32887746

113,Functional connexin35 increased in the myopic chicken retina,"Our previous research showed that increased phosphorylation of connexin (Cx)36 indicated extended coupling of AII amacrine cells (ACs) in the rod-dominant mouse myopic retina. This research will determine whether phosphorylation at serine 276 of Cx35-containing gap junctions increased in the myopic chicken, whose retina is cone-dominant. Refractive errors and ocular biometric dimensions of 7-days-old chickens were determined following 12 h and 7 days induction of myopia by a -10D lens. The expression pattern and size of Cx35-positive plaques were examined in the early (12 h) and compensated stages (7 days) of lens-induced myopia (LIM). At the same time, phosphorylation at serine 276 (functional assay) of Cx35 in strata 5 (S5) of the inner plexiform layer was investigated. The axial length of the 7 days LIM eyes was significantly longer than that of non-LIM controls (P < 0.05). Anti-phospho-Ser276 (Ser276-P)-labeled plaques were significantly increased in LIM retinas at both 12 h and 7 days. The density of Ser276-P of Cx35 was observed to increase after 12 h LIM. In the meanwhile, the areas of existing Cx35 plaques did not change. As there was more phosphorylation of connexin35 at Ser276 at both the early and late stages (12 h) and 7 days of LIM chicken retinal activity, the coupling with ACs could be increased in myopia development of the cone-dominated chicken retina.","['1 School of Optometry, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Kowloon, Hong Kong.', ""2 School of Clinical Medicine, University of Cambridge, Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, United Kingdom."", '3 Centre for Eye and Vision Research (CEVR), 17W Hong Kong Science Park, Hong Kong.']","Seema Banerjee, Qing Wang, George Tang, ChungHim So, Sze Wan Shan, King Kit Li, Chi-Wai Do, Feng Pan, ",Visual neuroscience,2021,amacrine cell; gap junction; myopia; retina.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33988110

This biological issue, however, is currently a challenging task in the age of post-genomic where data on protein sequences have expanded very fast. In this study, we propose iProDNA-CapsNet - a new prediction model identifying protein-DNA binding residues using an ensemble of capsule neural networks (CapsNets) on position specific scoring matrix (PSMM) profiles. The use of CapsNets promises an innovative approach to determine the location of DNA-binding residues. In this study, the benchmark datasets introduced by Hu et al. (2017), i.e., PDNA-543 and PDNA-TEST, were used to train and evaluate the model, respectively. To fairly assess the model performance, comparative analysis between iProDNA-CapsNet and existing state-of-the-art methods was done. Results:
        
      
      Under the decision threshold corresponding to false positive rate (FPR) ≈ 5%, the accuracy, sensitivity, precision, and Matthews's correlation coefficient (MCC) of our model is increased by about 2.0%, 2.0%, 14.0%, and 5.0% with respect to TargetDNA (Hu et al., 2017) and 1.0%, 75.0%, 45.0%, and 77.0% with respect to BindN+ (Wang et al., 2010), respectively. With regards to other methods not reporting their threshold settings, iProDNA-CapsNet also shows a significant improvement in performance based on most of the evaluation metrics. Even with different patterns of change among the models, iProDNA-CapsNets remains to be the best model having top performance in most of the metrics, especially MCC which is boosted from about 8.0% to 220.0%. Conclusions:
        
      
      According to all evaluation metrics under various decision thresholds, iProDNA-CapsNet shows better performance compared to the two current best models (BindN and TargetDNA). Our proposed approach also shows that CapsNet can potentially be used and adopted in other biological applications.","['1 School of Mathematics and Statistics, Victoria University of Wellington, Gate 7, Kelburn Parade, Wellington, 6140, New Zealand. binh.p.nguyen@vuw.ac.nz.', '2 School of Information and Communication Technology, Hanoi University of Science and Technology, 1 Dai Co Viet, Hanoi, 100000, Vietnam.', '3 School of Mathematics and Statistics, Victoria University of Wellington, Gate 7, Kelburn Parade, Wellington, 6140, New Zealand.', ""4 School of Marine Science and Technology, Northwestern Polytechnical University, 127 West Youyi Road, Xi'an, 710072, China. susantorahardja@ieee.org.""]","Binh P Nguyen, Quang H Nguyen, Giang-Nam Doan-Ngoc, Thanh-Hoang Nguyen-Vo, Susanto Rahardja, ",BMC bioinformatics,2019,Capsule neural network; Deep learning; PSSM; Prediction; Protein-DNA interaction; Residue.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31881828
115,Impact of Photoreceptor Loss on Retinal Circuitry,"Our sense of sight relies on photoreceptors, which transduce photons into the nervous system's electrochemical interpretation of the visual world. These precious photoreceptors can be disrupted by disease, injury, and aging. Once photoreceptors start to die, but before blindness occurs, the remaining retinal circuitry can withstand, mask, or exacerbate the photoreceptor deficit and potentially be receptive to newfound therapies for vision restoration. To maximize the retina's receptivity to therapy, one must understand the conditions that influence the state of the remaining retina. In this review, we provide an overview of the retina's structure and function in health and disease. We analyze a collection of observations on photoreceptor disruption and generate a predictive model to identify parameters that influence the retina's response. Finally, we speculate on whether the retina, with its remarkable capacity to function over light levels spanning nine orders of magnitude, uses these same adaptational mechanisms to withstand and perhaps mask photoreceptor loss.","['1 Department of Ophthalmology, University of California, San Francisco, California 94143, USA; email: Jooyeun.Lee@ucsf.edu, Rachel.Care@ucsf.edu, Luca.DellaSantina@ucsf.edu, Felice.Dunn@ucsf.edu.', '2 Bakar Computational Health Sciences Institute, University of California, San Francisco, California 94143, USA.']","Joo Yeun Lee, Rachel A Care, Luca Della Santina, Felice A Dunn, ",Annual review of vision science,2021,degeneration; photoreceptors; retina; retinal disease.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34524879
116,Towards Robust and Accurate Detection of Abnormalities in Musculoskeletal Radiographs with a Multi-Network Model,"This study proposes a novel multi-network architecture consisting of a multi-scale convolution neural network (MSCNN) with fully connected graph convolution network (GCN), named MSCNN-GCN, for the detection of musculoskeletal abnormalities via musculoskeletal radiographs. To obtain both detailed and contextual information for a better description of the characteristics of the radiographs, the designed MSCNN contains three subnetwork sequences (three different scales). It maintains high resolution in each sub-network, while fusing features with different resolutions. A GCN structure was employed to demonstrate global structure information of the images. Furthermore, both the outputs of MSCNN and GCN were fused through the concat of the two feature vectors from them, thus making the novel framework more discriminative. The effectiveness of this model was verified by comparing the performance of radiologists and three popular CNN models (DenseNet169, CapsNet, and MSCNN) with three evaluation metrics (Accuracy, F1 score, and Kappa score) using the MURA dataset (a large dataset of bone X-rays). Experimental results showed that the proposed framework not only reached the highest accuracy, but also demonstrated top scores on both F1 metric and kappa metric. This indicates that the proposed model achieves high accuracy and strong robustness in musculoskeletal radiographs, which presents strong potential for a feasible scheme with intelligent medical cases.","['1 School of Automation and Electrical Engineering, University of Science and Technology Beijing, Beijing 100083, China.', '2 School of AutoMation, Guangdong University of Petrochemical Technology, Maoming 525000, China.', '3 Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Soft Matter Science and Engineering, Beijing University of Chemical Technology, Beijing 100029, China.', '4 Department of Chemistry, Institute of Inorganic and Analytical Chemistry, Goethe-University, 60438 Frankfurt, Germany.']","Shuang Liang, Yu Gu, ","Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2020,CNN; GCN; abnormality detection; fusion; multi-network; musculoskeletal radiographs.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32498374

      We sought to identify implementation barriers and opportunities to increase utilization of the Canadian Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia (CDH) Collaborative's clinical practice guideline. Methods:
        
      
      A validated readiness assessment was sent via SurveyMonkey™ to CAPSNet site coordinators and local CDH stakeholders. The survey was open from 11/2018 to 02/2019. Data and responses were analyzed using descriptive statistics (REB 2019-4753). Results:
        
      
      Eighty-six responses were received, of which 65% (n = 56/86) were fully completed. The greatest number of responses came from neonatology (n = 27), pediatric surgery (n = 25), and respiratory therapy (n = 10). Seventy-eight percent (n = 67/86) of respondents were aware of the CDH guideline, and 63% (n = 54/86) used the entire guideline, while 23% (n = 20/86) used only certain sections. Besides recommendations pertaining to fetal intervention and ECLS, interdisciplinary long-term surveillance and prenatal diagnosis were considered most difficult to implement owing to funding limitations. Most respondents (n = 49/56; 87.5%) felt they could implement >75% of the recommendations. Establishing common team goals [i.e., minimize care variations] (n = 33/58;57%), provider buy-in [commitment of all health professionals to the guideline] (n = 28/58;48%), and regular compliance assessment (n = 23/58;40%) would increase uptake. Conclusion:
        
      
      There is national awareness of the CDH guideline. Implementation strategies ensuring common team goals, provider buy-in, and regular compliance assessment should increase guideline uptake/utilization. Consolidating funding for interdisciplinary long-term surveillance and prenatal diagnosis is necessary for any site-specific implementation strategy. Level of evidence:

118,VCNet: Hybrid Deep Learning Model for Detection and Classification of Lung Carcinoma Using Chest Radiographs,"Detection of malignant lung nodules from Computed Tomography (CT) images is a significant task for radiologists. But, it is time-consuming in nature. Despite numerous breakthroughs in studies on the application of deep learning models for the identification of lung cancer, researchers and doctors still face challenges when trying to deploy the model in clinical settings to achieve improved accuracy and sensitivity on huge datasets. In most situations, deep convolutional neural networks are used for detecting the region of the main nodule of the lung exclusive of considering the neighboring tissues of the nodule. Although the accuracy achieved through CNN is good enough but this models performance degrades when there are variations in image characteristics like: rotation, tiling, and other abnormal image orientations. CNN does not store relative spatial relationships among features in scanned images. As CT scans have high spatial resolution and are sensitive to misalignments during the scanning process, there is a requirement of a technique which helps in considering spatial information of image features also. In this paper, a hybrid model named VCNet is proposed by combining the features of VGG-16 and capsule network (CapsNet). VGG-16 model is used for object recognition and classification. CapsNet is used to address the shortcomings of convolutional neural networks for image rotation, tiling, and other abnormal image orientations. The performance of VCNeT is verified on the Lung Image Database Consortium (LIDC) image collection dataset. It achieves higher testing accuracy of 99.49% which is significantly better than MobileNet, Xception, and VGG-16 that has achieved an accuracy of 98, 97.97, and 96.95%, respectively. Therefore, the proposed hybrid VCNet framework can be used for the clinical purpose for nodule detection in lung carcinoma detection.","['1 Institute of Advance Computing, SAGE University, Indore, India.', '2 Bachelor Program in Interdisciplinary Studies, National Yunlin University of Science and Technology, Douliu, Taiwan.', '3 Future Technology Research Center, College of Future, National Yunlin University of Science and Technology, Douliu, Taiwan.']","Ritu Tandon, Shweta Agrawal, Arthur Chang, Shahab S Band, ",Frontiers in public health,2022,CT; MobileNet; VCNet; VGG-16; Xception; capsule network; convolutional neural networks.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35795700
119,Optimized CapsNet for Traffic Jam Speed Prediction Using Mobile Sensor Data under Urban Swarming Transportation,"Urban swarming transportation (UST) is a type of road transportation where multiple types of vehicles such as cars, buses, trucks, motorcycles, and bicycles, as well as pedestrians are allowed and mixed together on the roads. Predicting the traffic jam speed under UST is very different and difficult from the single road network traffic prediction which has been commonly studied in the intelligent traffic system (ITS) research. In this research, the road network wide (RNW) traffic prediction which predicts traffic jam speeds of multiple roads at once by utilizing citizens' mobile GPS sensor records is proposed to better predict traffic jam under UST. In order to conduct the RNW traffic prediction, a specific data preprocessing is needed to convert traffic data into an image representing spatial-temporal relationships among RNW. In addition, a revised capsule network (CapsNet), named OCapsNet, which utilizes nonlinearity functions in the first two convolution layers and the modified dynamic routing to optimize the performance of CapsNet, is proposed. The experiments were conducted using real-world urban road traffic data of Jakarta to evaluate the performance. The results show that OCapsNet has better performance than Convolution Neural Network (CNN) and original CapsNet with better accuracy and precision.","['1 Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei 106, Taiwan.', '2 Department of Industrial Management, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei 106, Taiwan.']","Hendrik Tampubolon, Chao-Lung Yang, Arnold Samuel Chan, Hendri Sutrisno, Kai-Lung Hua, ","Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019,capsule network; convolution neural network; smart city; traffic jam prediction; urban swarming transportation.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31795519
120,Pericyte dysfunction and loss of interpericyte tunneling nanotubes promote neurovascular deficits in glaucoma,"Reduced blood flow and impaired neurovascular coupling are recognized features of glaucoma, the leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide, but the mechanisms underlying these defects are unknown. Retinal pericytes regulate microcirculatory blood flow and coordinate neurovascular coupling through interpericyte tunneling nanotubes (IP-TNTs). Using two-photon microscope live imaging of the mouse retina, we found reduced capillary diameter and impaired blood flow at pericyte locations in eyes with high intraocular pressure, the most important risk factor to develop glaucoma. We show that IP-TNTs are structurally and functionally damaged by ocular hypertension, a response that disrupted light-evoked neurovascular coupling. Pericyte-specific inhibition of excessive Ca2+ influx rescued hemodynamic responses, protected IP-TNTs and neurovascular coupling, and enhanced retinal neuronal function as well as survival in glaucomatous retinas. Our study identifies pericytes and IP-TNTs as potential therapeutic targets to counter ocular pressure-related microvascular deficits, and provides preclinical proof of concept that strategies aimed to restore intrapericyte calcium homeostasis rescue autoregulatory blood flow and prevent neuronal dysfunction.","['1 Department of Neuroscience, Université de Montréal, Montréal, QC H3C 3J7, Canada; luis.alarconmartinez@unimelb.edu.au adriana.di.polo@umontreal.ca.', ""2 Neuroscience Division, Centre de Recherche du Centre Hospitalier de l'Université de Montréal, Montréal, QC H2X 0A9, Canada."", '3 Department of Neuroscience, Université de Montréal, Montréal, QC H3C 3J7, Canada.']","Luis Alarcon-Martinez, Yukihiro Shiga, Deborah Villafranca-Baughman, Nicolas Belforte, Heberto Quintero, Florence Dotigny, Jorge L Cueva Vargas, Adriana Di Polo, ",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2022,calcium homeostasis; glaucoma; neurovascular coupling; pericytes; retina.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35135877
121,A pre-trained convolutional neural network with optimized capsule networks for chest X-rays COVID-19 diagnosis,"Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is rapidly spreading worldwide. Recent studies show that radiological images contain accurate data for detecting the coronavirus. This paper proposes a pre-trained convolutional neural network (VGG16) with Capsule Neural Networks (CapsNet) to detect COVID-19 with unbalanced data sets. The CapsNet is proposed due to its ability to define features such as perspective, orientation, and size. Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) was employed to ensure that new samples were generated close to the sample center, avoiding the production of outliers or changes in data distribution. As the results may change by changing capsule network parameters (Capsule dimensionality and routing number), the Gaussian optimization method has been used to optimize these parameters. Four experiments have been done, (1) CapsNet with the unbalanced data sets, (2) CapsNet with balanced data sets based on class weight, (3) CapsNet with balanced data sets based on SMOTE, and (4) CapsNet hyperparameters optimization with balanced data sets based on SMOTE.

Here, we identified trophoblast glycoprotein (TPBG)-expressing GABAergic amacrine cells (ACs) that were selectively labeled in DAT-tdTomato transgenic mice. Methods:
        
      
      Retina and brain sections were prepared for immunostaining with antibodies against various biomarkers. Patch-sequencing was performed to obtain the transcriptomes of tdTomato-positive cells in DAT-tdTomato mice. Whole-cell recordings were conducted to identify responses to light stimulation. Results:
        
      
      Tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactive cells were colocalized with tdTomato-positive cells in substantia nigra pars compacta, but not in the retina. Transcriptomes collected from tdTomato-positive cells in retinas via Patch-sequencing exhibited the expression of marker genes of ACs (Pax6 and Slc32a1) and marker genes of GABAergic neurons (Gad1, Gad2, and Slc6a1). Immunostaining with antibodies against relevant proteins (GAD67, GAD65, and GABA) also confirmed transcriptomic results. Furthermore, tdTomato-positive cells in retinas selectively expressed Tpbg, a marker gene for distinct clusters molecularly defined, which was proved with TPBG immunoreactivity in fluorescently labeled cells. Finally, tdTomato-positive cells recorded showed ON-OFF responses to light stimulation. Conclusions:
        
      
      Ectopic expression occurs in the retina but not in the substantia nigra pars compacta in the DAT-tdTomato mouse, and fluorescently labeled cells in the retina are TPBG-expressing GABAergic ACs. This type of transgenic mice has been proved as an ideal tool to achieve efficient labeling of a distinct subset of ACs that selectively express Tpbg.","['1 State Key Laboratory of Ophthalmology, Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Ophthalmology and Visual Science, Guangzhou, China.', '2 European Molecular Biology Laboratory, European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI), Wellcome Genome Campus, Cambridge CB10 1SD, United Kingdom.', ""3 Translational Research Institute of Brain and Brain-Like Intelligence and Department of Anesthesiology, Shanghai Fourth People's Hospital Affiliated to Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."", '4 Research Unit of Ocular Development and Regeneration, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, China.', '5 Guangdong Province Key Laboratory of Brain Function and Disease, Guangzhou, China.']","Wanjing Huang, Qiang Xu, Feng Liu, Jing Su, Dongchang Xiao, Lei Tang, Zhao-Zhe Hao, Ruifeng Liu, Kangjian Xiang, Yalan Bi, Zhichao Miao, Xialin Liu, Yizhi Liu, Sheng Liu, ",Investigative ophthalmology & visual science,2022,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35551574
123,ST-CapsNet: Linking Spatial and Temporal Attention with Capsule Network for P300 Detection Improvement,"A brain-computer interface (BCI), which provides an advanced direct human-machine interaction, has gained substantial research interest in the last decade for its great potential in various applications including rehabilitation and communication. Among them, the P300-based BCI speller is a typical application that is capable of identifying the expected stimulated characters. However, the applicability of the P300 speller is hampered for the low recognition rate partially attributed to the complex spatio-temporal characteristics of the EEG signals. Here, we developed a deep-learning analysis framework named ST-CapsNet to overcome the challenges regarding better P300 detection using a capsule network with both spatial and temporal attention modules. Specifically, we first employed spatial and temporal attention modules to obtain refined EEG signals by capturing event-related information. Then the obtained signals were fed into the capsule network for discriminative feature extraction and P300 detection. In order to quantitatively assess the performance of the proposed ST-CapsNet, two publicly-available datasets (i.e., Dataset IIb of BCI Competition 2003 and Dataset II of BCI Competition III) were applied. A new metric of averaged symbols under repetitions (ASUR) was adopted to evaluate the cumulative effect of symbol recognition under different repetitions. In comparison with several widely-used methods (i.e., LDA, ERP-CapsNet, CNN, MCNN, SWFP, and MsCNN-TL-ESVM), the proposed ST-CapsNet framework significantly outperformed the state-of-the-art methods in terms of ASUR. More interestingly, the absolute values of the spatial filters learned by ST-CapsNet are higher in the parietal lobe and occipital region, which is consistent with the generation mechanism of P300.",NO_AFFILIATIONS,"Zehui Wang, Chuangquan Chen, Junhua Li, Feng Wan, Yu Sun, Hongtao Wang, ",IEEE transactions on neural systems and rehabilitation engineering : a publication of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society,2023,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37021904
124,Melatonin maintains inner blood-retinal barrier via inhibition of p38/TXNIP/NF-κB pathway in diabetic retinopathy,"The pathophysiology of diabetic retinopathy (DR) was complex. Under hyperglycemic conditions, the release of proinflammatory cytokines and the adhesion of leukocytes to retinal capillaries contribute to endothelial damage and the subsequent increase in vascular permeability resulting in macular edema. Melatonin, produced in the retina to regulate redox reactions and dopamine metabolism, plays protective roles against inflammation and oxidative stress. Considering its anti-inflammatory and antioxidative properties, melatonin was speculated to exert beneficial effects in DR. In this study, we characterized the protective effects of melatonin on the inner blood-retinal barrier (iBRB), as well as the possible mechanisms in experimental DR. Results showed that in diabetic rat retinas, the leakage of iBRB and the expression of inflammatory factors (VEGF, TNF-α, IL-1β, ICAM-1, and MMP9) increased dramatically, while the expression of tight junction proteins (ZO-1, occludin, JAM-A, and claudin-5) decreased significantly. The above changes were largely ameliorated by melatonin. The in vivo data were confirmed in vitro. In addition, the protein expressions of p38 MAPK, NF-κB, and TXNIP were upregulated significantly in diabetes and were downregulated following melatonin treatment. Melatonin could maintain the iBRB integrity by upregulating the expression of tight junction proteins via inhibiting p38/TXNIP/NF-κB pathway, thus decreasing the production of inflammatory factors. This study may shed light on the development of melatonin-based DR therapy.","['1 Department of Regenerative Medicine, and Department of Pharmacology, Tongji Eye Institute, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', ""2 Department of Ophthalmology, Shanghai General Hospital (Shanghai First People's Hospital), Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China."", '3 Department of Ophthalmology, Drexel University College of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States.', '4 Department of Ophthalmology, the Second Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', '5 National Clinical Research Center for Eye Diseases, Shanghai Key Laboratory of Ocular Fundus Diseases, Shanghai Engineering Center for Visual Science and Photomedicine, Shanghai Engineering Center for Precise Diagnosis and Treatment of Eye Diseases, Shanghai, China.']","Lei Tang, Chaoyang Zhang, Qian Yang, Hai Xie, Dandan Liu, Haibin Tian, Lixia Lu, Jing-Ying Xu, Weiye Li, Guoxu Xu, Qinghua Qiu, Kun Liu, Dawei Luo, Guo-Tong Xu, Jingfa Zhang, ",Journal of cellular physiology,NO_DATE,blood-retinal barrier; diabetic retinopathy; inflammation; melatonin.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33432588

126,Pathogenic roles of retinal glia in glaucoma,"Glaucoma, progressive optic neuropathy, is the first cause of blindness in Japan. Blindness in this disease is induced by damages or degeneration of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), retinal neurons transmit visual information to brain. An elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) is widely recognized as one of the most important risk factors and that IOP directly damages RGCs by mechanical stress, however, accumulating evidences have shown that a majority of Japanese patients for primary open angle glaucoma shows normal level of IOP. Thus, new target for glaucoma pathology is emerged. In this issue, we introduce potential roles of glial cells for pathogenesis of glaucoma. In the CNS, reactive gliosis has been recognized in a variety of neurodegenerative diseases. Such glial activation is also found in retinae of human glaucoma patients and animal models. Importantly, glial activation precedes RGS degeneration, indicating the possibility that reactive glial cells actively contribute to pathogenesis of glaucoma. In this issue, we will focus on macroglial cells such as Muller cells and astrocytes, and discuss their roles in glaucoma.","['1 Department of Neuropharmacology, Interdisciplinary Graduate School of Medicine, University of Yamanashi.']","Youichi Shinozaki, Schuichi Koizumi, ",Nihon yakurigaku zasshi.

127,Rbfox1 expression in amacrine cells is restricted to GABAergic and VGlut3 glycinergic cells,"Rbfox1 is a multifunctional RNA-binding protein that regulates alternative splicing, transcription, mRNA stability, and translation. Rbfox1 is an important regulator of gene networks involved in neurogenesis and neuronal function. Disruption of Rbfox function has been associated with several neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders. We have shown earlier that Rbfox1 is expressed in retinal ganglion and amacrine cells (ACs) and that its down-regulation in adult mouse retinas leads to deficiency of depth perception. In the present study, we used several markers of ACs, including gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), neuropeptide Y (NPY), glycine transporter (GlyT1), and vesicular glutamate transporter 3 (VGlut3) to identify types of ACs that express Rbfox1. Expression of Rbfox1 was observed predominantly in GABAergic ACs located in the inner nuclear layer (INL) and ganglion cell layer (GCL). All GABAergic/cholinergic starburst ACs and virtually all NPY-positive GABAergic ACs were also Rbfox1-positive. Among glycinergic ACs, a sparse population of Rbfox1/VGlut3-positive cells was identified, indicating that Rbfox1 is expressed in a very small population of glycinergic ACs. These data contribute to our understanding about molecular differences between various types of amacrine cells and the cell-specific gene networks regulated by Rbfox1.","['1 Stein Eye Institute, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90095, U.S.A.', '2 Brain Research Institute, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90095, U.S.A.']","Lei Gu, Joseph Caprioli, Natik Piri, ",Bioscience reports,2022,Choline acetyltransferase; Vesicular glutamate transporter 3; amacrine cells; ganglion cells; glycine transporter.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35730583
128,Optogenetic Strategies for Vision Restoration,"The loss of photoreceptor cells caused by retinal degenerative diseases leads to blindness. The optogenetic approach for restoring vision involves converting the surviving inner retinal neurons into photosensitive cells, thus imparting light sensitivity to the retina following the loss of photoreceptor cells. Our first demonstration of the feasibility of such an approach involved expressing ChR2 in the retinal ganglion cells of blind mice; since then, optogenetic vision restoration has been demonstrated by using a variety of optogenetic tools, especially microbial channelrhodopsins (ChRs). A ChR-based optogenetic therapy for treating blindness has advanced to clinical trials. In this chapter, we review our early proof-of-concept study of optogenetic vision restoration.

129,Accurate Automatic Glioma Segmentation in Brain MRI images Based on CapsNet,"Glioma is a highly invasive type of brain tumor with an irregular morphology and blurred infiltrative borders that may affect different parts of the brain. Therefore, it is a challenging task to identify the exact boundaries of the tumor in an MR image. In recent years, deep learning-based Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have gained popularity in the field of image processing and have been utilized for accurate image segmentation in medical applications. However, due to the inherent constraints of CNNs, tens of thousands of images are required for training, and collecting and annotating such a large number of images poses a serious challenge for their practical implementation. Here, for the first time, we have optimized a network based on the capsule neural network called SegCaps, to achieve accurate glioma segmentation on MR images. We have compared our results with a similar experiment conducted using the commonly utilized U-Net. Both experiments were performed on the BraTS2020 challenging dataset. For U-Net, network training was performed on the entire dataset, whereas a subset containing only 20% of the whole dataset was used for the SegCaps. To evaluate the results of our proposed method, the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) was used. SegCaps and U-Net reached DSC of 87.96% and 85.56% on glioma tumor core segmentation, respectively. The SegCaps uses convolutional layers as the basic components and has the intrinsic capability to generalize novel viewpoints. The network learns the spatial relationship between features using dynamic routing of capsules. These capabilities of the capsule neural network have led to a 3% improvement in results of glioma segmentation with fewer data while it contains 95.4% fewer parameters than U-Net.",NO_AFFILIATIONS,"M Jalili Aziz, A Amiri Tehrani Zade, P Farnia, M Alimohamadi, B Makkiabadi, A Ahmadian, J Alirezaie, ",Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society.

After obtaining the optimal method to be the encoder, this paper proposes a distribution-to-distribution mapping network to transform an encoded latent feature vector into a prior image feature vector. To visualize the brain thoughts, a pretrained IC-GAN model is used to receive these image feature vectors and generate images. Extensive experiments are carried out and the results show that the proposed method can effectively deal with the small sample data original from the less electrode channels. By examining the generated images coming from the EEG signals, it verifies that the proposed model is capable of reproducing the images seen by human eyes to some extent.","['1 Department of Computer Science and Technology, Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Chongqing, 40065, China.

131,Atom Search Optimization with Deep Learning Enabled Arabic Sign Language Recognition for Speaking and Hearing Disability Persons,"Sign language has played a crucial role in the lives of impaired people having hearing and speaking disabilities. They can send messages via hand gesture movement. Arabic Sign Language (ASL) recognition is a very difficult task because of its high complexity and the increasing intraclass similarity. Sign language may be utilized for the communication of sentences, letters, or words using diverse signs of the hands. Such communication helps to bridge the communication gap between people with hearing impairment and other people and also makes it easy for people with hearing impairment to express their opinions. Recently, a large number of studies have been ongoing in developing a system that is capable of classifying signs of dissimilar sign languages into the given class. Therefore, this study designs an atom search optimization with a deep convolutional autoencoder-enabled sign language recognition (ASODCAE-SLR) model for speaking and hearing disabled persons. The presented ASODCAE-SLR technique mainly aims to assist the communication of speaking and hearing disabled persons via the SLR process. To accomplish this, the ASODCAE-SLR technique initially pre-processes the input frames by a weighted average filtering approach. In addition, the ASODCAE-SLR technique employs a capsule network (CapsNet) feature extractor to produce a collection of feature vectors. For the recognition of sign language, the DCAE model is exploited in the study. At the final stage, the ASO algorithm is utilized as a hyperparameter optimizer which in turn increases the efficacy of the DCAE model. The experimental validation of the ASODCAE-SLR model is tested using the Arabic Sign Language dataset. The simulation analysis exhibit the enhanced performance of the ASODCAE-SLR model compared to existing models.","['1 Department of Information Systems, College of Computer and Information Sciences, Princess Nourah bint Abdulrahman University, P.O.

132,A COVID-19 medical image classification algorithm based on Transformer,"Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) is a new acute respiratory disease that has spread rapidly throughout the world. This paper proposes a novel deep learning network based on ResNet-50 merged transformer named RMT-Net. On the backbone of ResNet-50, it uses Transformer to capture long-distance feature information, adopts convolutional neural networks and depth-wise convolution to obtain local features, reduce the computational cost and acceleration the detection process. The RMT-Net includes four stage blocks to realize the feature extraction of different receptive fields. In the first three stages, the global self-attention method is adopted to capture the important feature information and construct the relationship between tokens. In the fourth stage, the residual blocks are used to extract the details of feature. Finally, a global average pooling layer and a fully connected layer perform classification tasks. Training, verification and testing are carried out on self-built datasets. The RMT-Net model is compared with ResNet-50, VGGNet-16, i-CapsNet and MGMADS-3. The experimental results show that the RMT-Net model has a Test_ acc of 97.65% on the X-ray image dataset, 99.12% on the CT image dataset, which both higher than the other four models. The size of RMT-Net model is only 38.5 M, and the detection speed of X-ray image and CT image is 5.46 ms and 4.12 ms per image, respectively. It is proved that the model can detect and classify COVID-19 with higher accuracy and efficiency.","['1 College of Electronic Information and Automation, Tianjin University of Science and Technology, Tianjin, 300222, China.', '2 College of Electronic Information and Automation, Tianjin University of Science and Technology, Tianjin, 300222, China. cxywxr@tust.edu.cn.']","Keying Ren, Geng Hong, Xiaoyan Chen, Zichen Wang, ",Scientific reports,2023,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37005476
133,Twitter sentiment analysis using ensemble based deep learning model towards COVID-19 in India and European countries,"As of November 2021, more than 24.80 crore people are diagnosed with the coronavirus in that around 50.20 lakhs people lost their lives, because of this infectious disease. By understanding the people's sentiment's expressed in their social media (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram etc.) helps their governments in controlling, monitoring, and eradicating the coronavirus. Compared to other social media's, the twitter data are indispensable in the extraction of useful awareness information related to any crisis. In this article, a sentiment analysis model is proposed to analyze the real time tweets, which are related to coronavirus. Initially, around 3100 Indian and European people's tweets are collected between the time period of 23.03.2020 to 01.11.2021. Next, the data pre-processing and exploratory investigation are accomplished for better understanding of the collected data. Further, the feature extraction is performed using Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF), GloVe, pre-trained Word2Vec, and fast text embedding's. The obtained feature vectors are fed to the ensemble classifier (Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) and Capsule Neural Network (CapsNet)) for classifying the user's sentiment's as anger, sad, joy, and fear.

134,Multi-channel EEG-based emotion recognition via a multi-level features guided capsule network,"In recent years, deep learning (DL) techniques, and in particular convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have shown great potential in electroencephalograph (EEG)-based emotion recognition. However, existing CNN-based EEG emotion recognition methods usually require a relatively complex stage of feature pre-extraction. More importantly, the CNNs cannot well characterize the intrinsic relationship among the different channels of EEG signals, which is essentially a crucial clue for the recognition of emotion. In this paper, we propose an effective multi-level features guided capsule network (MLF-CapsNet) for multi-channel EEG-based emotion recognition to overcome these issues. The MLF-CapsNet is an end-to-end framework, which can simultaneously extract features from the raw EEG signals and determine the emotional states. Compared with original CapsNet, it incorporates multi-level feature maps learned by different layers in forming the primary capsules so that the capability of feature representation can be enhanced. In addition, it uses a bottleneck layer to reduce the amount of parameters and accelerate the speed of calculation. Our method achieves the average accuracy of 97.97%, 98.31% and 98.32% on valence, arousal and dominance of DEAP dataset, respectively, and 94.59%, 95.26% and 95.13% on valence, arousal and dominance of DREAMER dataset, respectively. These results show that our method exhibits higher accuracy than the state-of-the-art methods.","['1 Department of Biomedical Engineering, Hefei University of Technology, Hefei 230009, China.

135,csORF-finder: an effective ensemble learning framework for accurate identification of multi-species coding short open reading frames,"Short open reading frames (sORFs) refer to the small nucleic fragments no longer than 303 nt in length that probably encode small peptides. To date, translatable sORFs have been found in both untranslated regions of messenger ribonucleic acids (RNAs; mRNAs) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), playing vital roles in a myriad of biological processes. As not all sORFs are translated or essentially translatable, it is important to develop a highly accurate computational tool for characterizing the coding potential of sORFs, thereby facilitating discovery of novel functional peptides. In light of this, we designed a series of ensemble models by integrating Efficient-CapsNet and LightGBM, collectively termed csORF-finder, to differentiate the coding sORFs (csORFs) from non-coding sORFs in Homo sapiens, Mus musculus and Drosophila melanogaster, respectively. To improve the performance of csORF-finder, we introduced a novel feature encoding scheme named trinucleotide deviation from expected mean (TDE) and computed all types of in-frame sequence-based features, such as i-framed-3mer, i-framed-CKSNAP and i-framed-TDE. Benchmarking results showed that these features could significantly boost the performance compared to the original 3-mer, CKSNAP and TDE features. Our performance comparisons showed that csORF-finder achieved a superior performance than the state-of-the-art methods for csORF prediction on multi-species and non-ATG initiation independent test datasets. Furthermore, we applied csORF-finder to screen the lncRNA datasets for identifying potential csORFs. The resulting data serve as an important computational repository for further experimental validation. We hope that csORF-finder can be exploited as a powerful platform for high-throughput identification of csORFs and functional characterization of these csORFs encoded peptides.","['1 Department of Biomedical Engineering, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing 211106, China.', '2 Biomedicine Discovery Institute and Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Monash University, Melbourne, VIC 3800, Australia.', '3 School of Computer Science and Engineering, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, 200 Xiaolingwei, Nanjing 210094, China.', '4 School of Biomedical Engineering and Informatics, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 211166, China.', '5 College of Automation Engineering, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing 211106, China.', '6 Monash Data Futures Institute, Monash University, Melbourne, VIC 3800, Australia.']","Meng Zhang, Jian Zhao, Chen Li, Fang Ge, Jing Wu, Bin Jiang, Jiangning Song, Xiaofeng Song, ",Briefings in bioinformatics,2022,coding sORFs; deep learning; ensemble learning; feature encoding; in-frame sequence features.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36094083
136,Betulinic Acid Protects from Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury in the Mouse Retina,"Ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) events are involved in the pathophysiology of numerous ocular diseases. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that betulinic acid protects from I/R injury in the mouse retina. Ocular ischemia was induced in mice by increasing intraocular pressure (IOP) to 110 mm Hg for 45 min, while the fellow eye served as a control. One group of mice received betulinic acid (50 mg/kg/day p.o. once daily) and the other group received the vehicle solution only. Eight days after the I/R event, the animals were killed and the retinal wholemounts and optic nerve cross-sections were prepared and stained with cresyl blue or toluidine blue, respectively, to count cells in the ganglion cell layer (GCL) of the retina and axons in the optic nerve. Retinal arteriole responses were measured in isolated retinas by video microscopy. The levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were assessed in retinal cryosections and redox gene expression was determined in isolated retinas by quantitative PCR. I/R markedly reduced cell number in the GCL and axon number in the optic nerve of the vehicle-treated mice. In contrast, only a negligible reduction in cell and axon number was observed following I/R in the betulinic acid-treated mice. Endothelial function was markedly reduced and ROS levels were increased in retinal arterioles of vehicle-exposed eyes following I/R, whereas betulinic acid partially prevented vascular endothelial dysfunction and ROS formation. Moreover, betulinic acid boosted mRNA expression for the antioxidant enzymes SOD3 and HO-1 following I/R. Our data provide evidence that betulinic acid protects from I/R injury in the mouse retina. Improvement of vascular endothelial function and the reduction in ROS levels appear to contribute to the neuroprotective effect.","['1 Department of Ophthalmology, University Medical Center, Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz, Langenbeckstrasse 1, 55131 Mainz, Germany.', '2 Laboratory of Corneal Immunology, Transplantation and Regeneration, Schepens Eye Research Institute, Massachusetts Eye and Ear, Department of Ophthalmology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02114, USA.', '3 Institute of Pathology, University Medical Center, Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz, Langenbeckstrasse 1, 55131 Mainz, Germany.', '4 Institute of Pathology, University of Regensburg, Franz-Josef-Strauß-Allee 11, 93053 Regensburg, Germany.', '5 Department of Cardiology 1, Laboratory of Molecular Cardiology, University Medical Center, Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz, Building 605, Langenbeckstrasse 1, 55131 Mainz, Germany.', '6 Department of Pharmacology, University Medical Center, Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz, Langenbeckstrasse 1, 55131 Mainz, Germany.']","Aytan Musayeva, Johanna C Unkrig, Mayagozel B Zhutdieva, Caroline Manicam, Yue Ruan, Panagiotis Laspas, Panagiotis Chronopoulos, Marie L Göbel, Norbert Pfeiffer, Christoph Brochhausen, Andreas Daiber, Matthias Oelze, Huige Li, Ning Xia, Adrian Gericke, ",Cells,2021,arterioles; betulinic acid; ischemia-reperfusion injury; reactive oxygen species; retina.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34572088
137,CB-Fake: A multimodal deep learning framework for automatic fake news detection using capsule neural network and BERT,"The progressive growth of today's digital world has made news spread exponentially faster on social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and Weibo. Unverified news is often disseminated in the form of multimedia content like text, picture, audio, or video. The dissemination of such false news deceives the public and leads to protests and creates troubles for the public and the government. Hence, it is essential to verify the authenticity of the news at an early stage before sharing it with the public. Earlier fake news detection (FND) approaches combined textual and visual features, but the semantic correlations between words were not addressed and many informative visual features were lost. To address this issue, an automated fake news detection system is proposed, which fuses textual and visual features to create a multimodal feature vector with high information content. The proposed work incorporates the bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) model to extract the textual features, which preserves the semantic relationships between words. Unlike the convolutional neural network (CNN), the proposed capsule neural network (CapsNet) model captures the most informative visual features from an image. These features are combined to obtain a richer data representation that helps to determine whether the news is fake or real. We investigated the performance of our model against different baselines using two publicly accessible datasets, Politifact and Gossipcop. Our proposed model achieves significantly better classification accuracy of 93% and 92% for the Politifact and Gossipcop datasets, respectively, compared to 84.6% and 85.6% for the SpotFake+ model.","['1 Department of Computer Science and Engineering, National Institute of Technology, Tiruchirappalli, India.', '2 Software Development Engineer Visa Inc, Bengaluru, India.']","Balasubramanian Palani, Sivasankar Elango, Vignesh Viswanathan K, ",Multimedia tools and applications,NO_DATE,BERT; Capsule neural network; Deep learning; Fake news detection; Routing-by-agreement.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34975284

Here, based on a fluorescence microscopy 2D image dataset of HeLa cells, the CapsNet network model was used to classify ten types of images of proteins in different subcellular compartments. Capsules in the CapsNet network model were trained to capture the possibility of certain features and variants rather than to capture the characteristics of a specific variant. The capsule at the same level predicted the instantiation parameters of the higher level capsule through the transformation matrix, and the higher level capsule became active when multiple dynamic routing forecasts were consistent.

Retinal prostheses are promising devices to restore vision for patients with severe age-related macular degeneration or retinitis pigmentosa disease. The visual processing mechanism embodied in retinal prostheses play an important role in the restoration effect. Its performance depends on our understanding of the retina's working mechanism and the evolvement of computer vision models. Recently, remarkable progress has been made in the field of processing algorithm for retinal prostheses where the new discovery of the retina's working principle and state-of-the-arts computer vision models are combined together.Approach.

140,"Identifying the histologic subtypes of non-small cell lung cancer with computed tomography imaging: a comparative study of capsule net, convolutional neural network, and radiomics","Background:
        
      
      Discriminating the subtypes of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) based on computed tomography (CT) images is a challenging task for radiologists. Although several machine learning methods such as radiomics, and deep learning methods such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been proposed to explore the problem, large sample sizes are required for effective training, and this may not be easily achieved in single-center datasets. Methods:
        
      
      In this study, an automated subtype recognition model with capsule net (CapsNet) was developed for the subtype discrimination of NSCLC. CapsNet utilizes an activity vector to record the relative spatial relationship of image elements that can subsequently better delineate the global image characteristics. CT images of 72 adenocarcinoma (AC) and 54 squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) patients were retrospectively collected from a single clinical center. The cancer region on the CT image was manually segmented for every subject by an experienced radiologist, and CapsNet, CNN, and four radiomics models were then used to construct the recognition model. Results:
        
      
      The study demonstrated that CapsNet achieved the best discriminative performance (accuracy 81.3%, specificity 80.7%, sensitivity 82.2%) although its area under the curve was just marginally better than that of the optimal random forest (RF) based radiomics model. Not surprisingly, the performance of the CNN was only comparable to the other radiomics models. Conclusions:
        
      
      This study demonstrated that CapsNet is a viable potential framework for discriminating the subtypes of NSCLC, and its use could be extended to the recognition of other diseases especially in limited single-center datasets.","['1 School of Biomedical Engineering, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.', ""2 Department of Radiology, Beijing Children's Hospital, Capital Medical University, National Center for Children's Health, Beijing, China."", '3 Center for Biomedical Image Computing and Analytics, Department of Radiology, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', '4 Department of Radiology, Third Medical Center of PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China.']","Han Liu, Zhicheng Jiao, Wenjuan Han, Bin Jing, ",Quantitative imaging in medicine and surgery,NO_DATE,Capsule net (CapsNet); computed tomography imaging (CT imaging); convolutional neural network (CNN); non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC); radiomics.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34079739
141,Ensemble Capsule Network with an Attention Mechanism for the Fault Diagnosis of Bearings from Imbalanced Data Samples,"In order to solve the problem of imbalanced and noisy data samples for the fault diagnosis of rolling bearings, a novel ensemble capsule network (Capsnet) with a convolutional block attention module (CBAM) that is based on a weighted majority voting method is proposed in this study. Firstly, the complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN) method was used to decompose the raw vibration signal into different IMF signals, which are noise reduction signals. Secondly, the IMF signals were input into the Capsnet with CBAM in order to diagnose the fault category preliminarily. Finally, the weighted majority voting method was utilized so as to fuse all of the preliminary diagnosis results in order to obtain the final diagnostic decision. In order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed ensemble of Capsnet with CBAM, this method was applied to the fault diagnosis of rolling bearings with imbalanced and different SNR data samples. The diagnostic results show that the proposed diagnostic method can achieve higher levels of accuracy than other methods, such as single CNN, single Capsnet, ensemble CNN and an ensemble capsule network without CBAM and that it has stronger immunity to noise than an ensemble capsule network without CBAM.","['1 Centre for Advances in Reliability and Safety, Hong Kong.', '2 School of Machinery and Automation, Wuhan University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430081, China.', '3 Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong.', '4 School of Transportation and Logistics Engineering, Wuhan University of Technology, Wuhan 430062, China.']","Zengbing Xu, Carman Ka Man Lee, Yaqiong Lv, Jeffery Chan, ","Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2022,ensemble capsule network; fault diagnosis; imbalanced dataset.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35898042

      Standardized protocols have been shown to improve outcomes in several pediatric surgical conditions. We implemented a multi-disciplinary gastroschisis practice bundle at our institution in 2013. We sought to evaluate its impact on closure type and early clinical outcomes. Methods:
        
      
      We performed a retrospective review of uncomplicated gastroschisis patients treated at our institution between 2008-2019. Patients were divided into two groups: pre- and post-protocol implementation. Multivariate logistic regression was used to compare closure location, method, and success. Results:
        
      
      Neonates (pre-implementation n = 53, post-implementation n = 43) were similar across baseline variables. Successful immediate closure rates were comparable (75.5% vs. 72.1%, p = 0.71). The proportion of bedside closures increased significantly after protocol implementation (35.3% vs. 95.4%, p < 0.01), as did the proportion of sutureless closures (32.5% vs. 71.0%, p < 0.01). Median postoperative mechanical ventilation decreased significantly (4 days IQR [3, 5] vs. 2 days IQR [1, 3], p < 0.01). Postoperative complications and duration of parenteral nutrition were equivalent. After controlling for potential confounding, infants in the post-implementation group had a 44.0 times higher odds of undergoing bedside closure (95% CI: 9.0, 215.2, p < 0.01) and a 7.7 times higher odds of undergoing sutureless closure (95% CI: 2.3, 25.1, p < 0.01). Conclusions:
        
      
      Implementing a standardized gastroschisis protocol significantly increased the proportion of immediate bedside sutureless closures and decreased the duration of mechanical ventilation, without increasing postoperative complications.

143,3D-MCN: A 3D Multi-scale Capsule Network for Lung Nodule Malignancy Prediction,"Despite the advances in automatic lung cancer malignancy prediction, achieving high accuracy remains challenging. Existing solutions are mostly based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which require a large amount of training data. Most of the developed CNN models are based only on the main nodule region, without considering the surrounding tissues. Obtaining high sensitivity is challenging with lung nodule malignancy prediction. Moreover, the interpretability of the proposed techniques should be a consideration when the end goal is to utilize the model in a clinical setting. Capsule networks (CapsNets) are new and revolutionary machine learning architectures proposed to overcome shortcomings of CNNs. Capitalizing on the success of CapsNet in biomedical domains, we propose a novel model for lung tumor malignancy prediction. The proposed framework, referred to as the 3D Multi-scale Capsule Network (3D-MCN), is uniquely designed to benefit from: (i) 3D inputs, providing information about the nodule in 3D; (ii) Multi-scale input, capturing the nodule's local features, as well as the characteristics of the surrounding tissues, and; (iii) CapsNet-based design, being capable of dealing with a small number of training samples. The proposed 3D-MCN architecture predicted lung nodule malignancy with a high accuracy of 93.12%, sensitivity of 94.94%, area under the curve (AUC) of 0.9641, and specificity of 90% when tested on the LIDC-IDRI dataset.

Currently, the commonly used convolutional neural network (CNN) model requires a large number of datasets, and the accuracy of the basic capsule network for multiple classification is limital. For this reason, this paper proposes a novel model based on CNN and CapsNet. Methods:
        
      
      The proposed model integrates CNN and CapsNet. And attention mechanism module and multi-branch lightweight module are applied to enhance performance. Use the contrast adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE) algorithm to preprocess the image to enhance image contrast. The preprocessed images are input into the network for training, and ReLU was used as the activation function to adjust the parameters to achieve the optimal. Result:
        
      
      The test dataset includes 1200 X-ray images (400 COVID-19, 400 viral pneumonia, and 400 normal), and we replace CNN of VGG16, InceptionV3, Xception, Inception-Resnet-v2, ResNet50, DenseNet121, and MoblieNetV2 and integrate with CapsNet. Compared with CapsNet, this network improves 6.96%, 7.83%, 9.37%, 10.47%, and 10.38% in accuracy, area under the curve (AUC), recall, and F1 scores, respectively. In the binary classification experiment, compared with CapsNet, the accuracy, AUC, accuracy, recall rate, and F1 score were increased by 5.33%, 5.34%, 2.88%, 8.00%, and 5.56%, respectively. Conclusion:

145,Intravitreally Injected Methylene Blue Protects Retina against Acute Ocular Hypertension in Rats,"Purpose:
        
      
      To assess the neuroprotective effects of methylene blue (MB) in a rat model of acute ocular hypertension (AOH) and explore its possible mechanisms. Methods:
        
      
      Our AOH rat model was obtained with anterior chamber perfusion for 60 min. After that, 100 μM MB was injected into the vitreous cavity immediately after injury. Electroretinogram, fundus photography, optical coherence tomography (OCT) and retina morphology examination were utilized to quantify retinal damage before surgery, as well as 7, 14 and 28 days after. The average number of surviving retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) was counted after fluorescent retrograde labelling with 4% DiI. And TUNEL assay was used to investigate retinal cell apoptosis at 24 hours after AOH. Nrf2 and BACE1 in the retina were determined by RT-qPCR analysis. Results:
        
      
      AOH did produce a severe degeneration effect on the whole retinal layer. Intravitreally injected MB maintained certain retinal thickness after AOH, reduced the destruction of electroretinograms, and enhanced RGCs survival. The average number of TUNEL-labelled cells statistically reduced in the MB-treated retina tissue compared with retina treated with normal saline. The relative mRNA level of Nrf2 was also much higher in the MB-treated retinas after AOH, and the expression of BACE1 had a decline in the AOH + MB group. Conclusions:
        
      
      MB can protect the retina from AOH injury and the possible mechanism might involve the inhibition of BACE1 expression and the activation of Nrf2 antioxidant pathway.","['1 Institute of Advanced Materials for Nano-Bio Applications, School of Ophthalmology and Optometry, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, Zhejiang, China.', ""2 Henan Provincial People's Hospital and People's Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Henan Eye Institute, Henan Eye Hospital, Zhengzhou, Henan, China.""]","Zhiqiang Ye, Xiaoli Li, Dongliang Zheng, Shuaili Pei, Pei Cheng, Lishu Zhang, Lin Zhu, ",Current eye research,NO_DATE,BACE1; Nrf2; Retinal ganglion cell; acute ocular hypertension; methylene blue.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34165383
146,Arf-like Protein 2 (ARL2) Controls Microtubule Neogenesis during Early Postnatal Photoreceptor Development,"Arf-like protein 2 (ARL2) is a ubiquitously expressed small GTPase with multiple functions. In a cell culture, ARL2 participates with tubulin cofactor D (TBCD) in the neogenesis of tubulin αβ-heterodimers, the building blocks of microtubules. To evaluate this function in the retina, we conditionally deleted ARL2 in mouse retina at two distinct stages, either during the embryonic development (retArl2-/-) or after ciliogenesis specifically in rods (rodArl2-/-). retArl2-/- retina sections displayed distorted nuclear layers and a disrupted microtubule cytoskeleton (MTC) as early as postnatal day 6 (P6). Rod and cone outer segments (OS) did not form. By contrast, the rod ARL2 knockouts were stable at postnatal day 35 and revealed normal ERG responses. Cytoplasmic dynein is reduced in retArl2-/- inner segments (IS), suggesting that dynein may be unstable in the absence of a normal MTC. We investigated the microtubular stability in the absence of either ARL2 (retARL2-/-) or DYNC1H1 (retDync1h1-/-), the dynein heavy chain, and found that both the retArl2-/- and retDync1h1-/- retinas exhibited reduced microtubules and nuclear layer distortion. The results suggest that ARL2 and dynein depend on each other to generate a functional MTC during the early photoreceptor development.","['1 Department of Ophthalmology, University of Utah Health Science Center, Salt Lake City, UT 84132, USA.', '2 Department of Neurobiology & Anatomy, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT 84112, USA.', '3 Department of Biology, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT 84112, USA.']","Cecilia D Gerstner, Michelle Reed, Tiffanie M Dahl, Guoxin Ying, Jeanne M Frederick, Wolfgang Baehr, ",Cells,2022,Arf-like protein 2 (ARL2); dynein heavy chain (DYNC1H1); microtubule cytoskeleton (MTC); retina; rod photoreceptors; tubulin αβ-heterodimers.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36611941

148,Effects of high-fat diet and Apoe deficiency on retinal structure and function in mice,"To investigate the effects of a high-fat diet (HFD) and apolipoprotein E (Apoe) deficiency on retinal structure and function in mice. Apoe KO mice and wild-type C57BL/6J mice were given a low-fat diet (LFD) or a HFD for 32 weeks. Blood glucose, serum lipids, body weight and visceral fat weight were evaluated. Retinal sterol quantification was carried out by isotope dilution gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The cholesterol metabolism related genes SCAP-SREBP expressions were detected by qRT-PCR. Retinal function was recorded using an electroretinogram. The thickness of each layer of the retina was measured by optical coherence tomography. Fundus fluorescein angiography was performed to detect retinal vasculature changes. Immunohistochemical staining was used to determine the expression of NF-κB, TNF-α and VEGFR2 in the retina among HFD, HFD Apoe-/-, LFD Apoe-/- and WT mice retinas. HFD feeding caused the mice to gain weight and develop hypercholesterinemia, while Apoe-/- abnormalities also affected blood lipid metabolism. Both HFD and Apoe deficiency elevated retinal cholesterol, especially in the HFD Apoe-/- mice. No up-regulated expression of SCAP-SREBP was observed as a negative regulator. Impaired retinal functions, thinning retinas and abnormal retinal vasculature were observed in the peripheral retinas of the HFD and Apoe-/- mice compared with those in the normal chow group, particularly in the HFD Apoe-/- mice. Moreover, the expression of NF-κB in the retinas of the HFD and Apoe-/- mice was increased, together with upregulated TNF-α mRNA levels and TNF-α expression in the layer of retinal ganglion cells of the peripheral retina. At the same time, the expression level of VEGFR2 was elevated in the intervention groups, most notably in HFD Apoe-/- mice. HFD or Apoe gene deletion had certain adverse effects on retinal function and structure, which were far below the combined factors and induced harm to the retina. Furthermore, HFD caused retinal ischemia and hypoxia. Additionally, Apoe abnormality increased susceptibility to ischemia. These changes upregulated NF-κB expression in ganglion cells and activated downstream TNF-α. Simultaneously, they activated VEGFR2, accelerating angiogenesis and vascular permeability. All of the aforementioned outcomes initiated inflammatory responses to trigger ganglion cell apoptosis and aggravate retinal neovascularization.","['1 Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, China.', '2 Tianjin Key Lab of Ophthalmology and Visual Science, Tianjin Eye Hospital, Tianjin Eye Institute, Tianjin, China.', '3 Nankai University Affiliated Eye Hospital, Tianjin, China.', '4 Tianjin Key Lab of Ophthalmology and Visual Science, Tianjin Eye Hospital, Tianjin Eye Institute, Tianjin, China. yatuguo@163.com.', '5 Nankai University Affiliated Eye Hospital, Tianjin, China. yatuguo@163.com.', '6 State Key Laboratory of Food Nutrition and Safety, Tianjin University of Science and Technology, Tianjin, China.', '7 Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, China. chenxianew@163.com.', '8 Tianjin Key Lab of Ophthalmology and Visual Science, Tianjin Eye Hospital, Tianjin Eye Institute, Tianjin, China. chenxianew@163.com.', '9 Nankai University Affiliated Eye Hospital, Tianjin, China. chenxianew@163.com.', '10 Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, China. zhangweinew@163.com.', '11 Tianjin Key Lab of Ophthalmology and Visual Science, Tianjin Eye Hospital, Tianjin Eye Institute, Tianjin, China. zhangweinew@163.com.', '12 Nankai University Affiliated Eye Hospital, Tianjin, China. zhangweinew@163.com.']","Xiupeng Cao, Yatu Guo, Yuchuan Wang, Hao Wang, Dong Liu, Yibo Gong, Jue Wang, Xia Chen, Wei Zhang, ",Scientific reports,2020,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33139746
149,eNOS controls angiogenic sprouting and retinal neovascularization through the regulation of endothelial cell polarity,"The roles of nitric oxide (NO) and endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) in the regulation of angiogenesis are well documented. However, the involvement of eNOS in the sprouting of endothelial tip-cells at the vascular front during sprouting angiogenesis remains poorly defined. In this study, we show that downregulation of eNOS markedly inhibits VEGF-stimulated migration of endothelial cells but increases their polarization, as evidenced by the reorientation of the Golgi in migrating monolayers and by the fewer filopodia on tip cells at ends of sprouts in endothelial cell spheroids. The effect of eNOS inhibition on EC polarization was prevented in Par3-depleted cells. Importantly, downregulation of eNOS increased the expression of polarity genes, such as PARD3B, PARD6A, PARD6B, PKCΖ, TJP3, and CRB1 in endothelial cells. In retinas of eNOS knockout mice, vascular development is retarded with decreased vessel density and vascular branching. Furthermore, tip cells at the extremities of the vascular front have a marked reduction in the number of filopodia per cell and are more oriented. In a model of oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR), eNOS deficient mice are protected during the initial vaso-obliterative phase, have reduced pathological neovascularization, and retinal endothelial tip cells have fewer filopodia. Single-cell RNA sequencing of endothelial cells from OIR retinas revealed enrichment of genes related to cell polarity in the endothelial tip-cell subtype of eNOS deficient mice. These results indicate that inhibition of eNOS alters the polarity program of endothelial cells, which increases cell polarization, regulates sprouting angiogenesis and normalizes pathological neovascularization during retinopathy.","['1 Department of Pharmacology and Physiology, Faculty of Medicine, Université de Montréal, Montreal, QC, Canada.', '2 Département des Sciences Biologiques, Université du Québec à Montréal (UQAM), Montreal, QC, Canada. oubaha.malika@uqam.ca.', '3 Department of Pediatrics and Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Ste-Justine, Université de Montréal, Montreal, QC, Canada.', '4 School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China.', '5 Donnelly Centre, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada.', '6 Department of Ophthalmology, Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital Research Centre, Université de Montréal, Montreal, QC, Canada.', '7 Department of Pharmacology and Physiology, Faculty of Medicine, Université de Montréal, Montreal, QC, Canada. jean-philippe.gratton@umontreal.ca.']","Tracy L Smith, Malika Oubaha, Gael Cagnone, Cécile Boscher, Jin Sung Kim, Yassine El Bakkouri, Ying Zhang, Rony Chidiac, Jeanne Corriveau, Chantal Delisle, Gregor U Andelfinger, Przemyslaw Sapieha, Jean-Sébastien Joyal, Jean-Philippe Gratton, ",Cellular and molecular life sciences : CMLS,2021,Angiogenesis; Nitric oxide; Polarity; Retina; Retinopathies; Tip-cells; VEGF.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34971428

151,Fundus motion during mfERG testing,"Purpose:
        
      
      The purpose of this study was to assess eye movements during a multifocal ERG (mfERG) recording. This study evaluated the relationship between bivariate contour ellipse areas (BCEAs), mfERG amplitudes (Amps) and mfERG implicit times (ITs) with repeat testing and experienced subjects. Methods:
        
      
      Thirty subjects were selected (15 experienced to ocular procedures and 15 novices). All were confirmed to have healthy retinas and at least 20/25 vision. MfERGs with a stimulus near 100% contrast and 4-min m-sequence were recorded on two different days using our common clinical technique, which did not constrain the head. VERIS with fundus monitoring system was used for recording with a Burian-Allen electrode. An external camera captured the fundus during each mfERG recording. The optic nerve head position was tracked in each video using a custom algorithm in order to determine BCEAs. Each subject performed one mfERG on two different days. MfERGs were analyzed for Amps and ITs for the fovea and whole eye. Results:
        
      
      There was no correlation between the mfERG metrics and BCEAs with repeat testing. There were also no differences between the experienced and novice subjects for mfERG Amps, ITs or BCEAs. Eye movements between visits were highly correlated (multiple r = 0.67). BCEAs were larger during mfERGs (1.04 ± 0.8 deg2) than those observed in previous literature using brief viewing tasks (< 0.3 deg2). The proportion of time spent fixating within 1.0 and 2.0 degrees of the central hexagon was 68 and 93%, respectively. Conclusions:
        
      
      This study is the first to evaluate the stability of the retina while recording a mfERG in healthy subjects and indicates that the center of fixation during a mfERG stays within the central hexagon. Eye stability during an initial recording is the best indicator of stability on the second recording. The amount of movement during these recordings did not seem to affect the mfERG Amps or ITs. These data suggest clinical confidence with mfERGs when recording novice patients.","['1 University of Houston College of Optometry, Houston, TX, USA. jsmith41@central.uh.edu.', '2 University of Houston College of Optometry, Houston, TX, USA.']","Jennyffer D Smith, Allison Jussel, Rachel Wang, Daniel R Coates, Wendy W Harrison, ",Documenta ophthalmologica.

153,Training much deeper spiking neural networks with a small number of time-steps,"Spiking Neural Network (SNN) is a promising energy-efficient neural architecture when implemented on neuromorphic hardware. The Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to SNN conversion method, which is the most effective SNN training method, has successfully converted moderately deep ANNs to SNNs with satisfactory performance. However, this method requires a large number of time-steps, which hurts the energy efficiency of SNNs. How to effectively covert a very deep ANN (e.g., more than 100 layers) to an SNN with a small number of time-steps remains a difficult task. To tackle this challenge, this paper makes the first attempt to propose a novel error analysis framework that takes both the ""quantization error"" and the ""deviation error"" into account, which comes from the discretization of SNN dynamicsthe neuron's coding scheme and the inconstant input currents at intermediate layers, respectively. Particularly, our theories reveal that the ""deviation error"" depends on both the spike threshold and the input variance. Based on our theoretical analysis, we further propose the Threshold Tuning and Residual Block Restructuring (TTRBR) method that can convert very deep ANNs (>100 layers) to SNNs with negligible accuracy degradation while requiring only a small number of time-steps. With very deep networks, our TTRBR method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet classification tasks.","['1 The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen, China; Shenzhen Research Institute of Big Data, Shenzhen 518115, China.

To make up the deficit, emerging hardware technologies and software knowledge in the fields of neuroscience, electronics, and computer science have made it possible to design biologically realistic robots controlled by spiking neural networks (SNNs), inspired by the mechanism of brains. However, a comprehensive review on controlling robots based on SNNs is still missing. In this paper, we survey the developments of the past decade in the field of spiking neural networks for control tasks, with particular focus on the fast emerging robotics-related applications. We first highlight the primary impetuses of SNN-based robotics tasks in terms of speed, energy efficiency, and computation capabilities. We then classify those SNN-based robotic applications according to different learning rules and explicate those learning rules with their corresponding robotic applications. We also briefly present some existing platforms that offer an interaction between SNNs and robotics simulations for exploration and exploitation. Finally, we conclude our survey with a forecast of future challenges and some associated potential research topics in terms of controlling robots based on SNNs.","['1 Chair of Robotics, Artificial Intelligence and Real-time Systems, Department of Informatics, Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany.', '2 Department of Data and Computer Science, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China.']","Zhenshan Bing, Claus Meschede, Florian Röhrbein, Kai Huang, Alois C Knoll, ",Frontiers in neurorobotics,2018,brain-inspired robotics; learning control; neurorobotics; spiking neural network; survey.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30034334
156,Evidence of regional specializations in regenerated zebrafish retina,"Adult zebrafish are capable of functional retinal regeneration following damage. A goal of vision science is to stimulate or permit a similar process in mammals to treat human retinal disease and trauma. Ideally such a process would reconstitute the stereotyped, two-dimensional topographic patterns and regional specializations of specific cell types, functionally important for representation of the visual field. An example in humans is the cone-rich fovea, essential for high-acuity color vision. Stereotyped, global topographic patterns of specific retinal cell types are also found in zebrafish, particularly for cone types expressing the tandemly-replicated lws (long wavelength-sensitive) and rh2 (middle wavelength-sensitive) opsins. Here we examine whether regionally specialized patterns of LWS1 and LWS2 cones are restored in regenerated retinas in zebrafish. Adult transgenic zebrafish carrying fluorescent reporters for lws1 and lws2 were subjected to retinal lesions that destroy all neurons but spare glia, via intraocular injection of the neurotoxin ouabain. Regenerated and contralateral control retinas were mounted whole or sectioned, and imaged. Overall spatial patterns of lws1 vs. lws2 opsin-expressing cones in regenerated retinas were remarkably similar to those of control retinas, with LWS1 cones in ventral/peripheral regions, and LWS2 cones in dorsal/central regions. However, LWS2 cones occupied a smaller fraction of regenerated retina, and several cones co-expressed the lws1 and lws2 reporters in regenerated retinas. Local patterns of regenerated LWS1 cones showed modest reductions in regularity. These results suggest that some of the regional patterning information, or the source of such signals, for LWS cone subtypes may be retained by undamaged cell types (Müller glia or RPE) and re-deployed during regeneration.","['1 Department of Biological Sciences, University of Idaho, Moscow, ID, 82844, USA.

It comprises five classes of neurons and one glial type cell. During development, but prior to a vertebrate's eyes opening, retinal circuits are refined by endogenous neural activity. Characteristic patterns of activity, including oscillatory activity, occur in the normal retina, whereas distinctive alternative patterns occur in abnormal retinas.

158,Adaptations and evolutionary trajectories of the snake rod and cone photoreceptors,"Most vertebrates have duplex retinas, with two classes of photoreceptors, rods and cones. In the group of Snakes, however, distinct patterns of retinal morphology are associated with transitions between diurnal-nocturnal habits and reflect important adaptations of their visual system. Pure-cone, pure-rod and duplex retinas were described in different species, and this variability led Gordon Walls (1934) to formulate the transmutation theory, which suggests that rods and cones are not fixed entities, but can assume transitional states. Three opsin genes are expressed in retinas of most snake species, lws, rh1, and sws1, and recent studies have shown that the rhodopsin gene, rh1, is expressed in pure-cone retinas of diurnal snakes. This expression raised many questions about the nature of transmutation and functional aspects of the rhodopsin in a cone-like photoreceptor. Extreme differences in the retinal architecture of diurnal and nocturnal snakes also highlight the complexity of adaptations of their visual structures, which might have contributed to the adaptive radiation of this group and will be discussed in this review.","['1 Department of Experimental Psychology, Psychology Institute, University of São Paulo, Av.

160,Retinal energy metabolism in health and glaucoma,"Energy metabolism refers to the processes by which life transfers energy to do cellular work. The retina's relatively large energy demands make it vulnerable to energy insufficiency. In addition, evolutionary pressures to optimize human vision have been traded against retinal ganglion cell bioenergetic fragility. Details of the metabolic profiles of the different retinal cells remain poorly understood and are challenging to resolve. Detailed immunohistochemical mapping of the energy pathway enzymes and substrate transporters has provided some insights and highlighted interspecies differences. The different spatial metabolic patterns between the vascular and avascular retinas can account for some inconsistent data in the literature. There is a consilience of evidence that at least some individuals with glaucoma have impaired RGC energy metabolism, either due to impaired nutrient supply or intrinsic metabolic perturbations. Bioenergetic-based therapy for glaucoma has a compelling pathophysiological foundation and is supported by recent successes in animal models. Recent demonstrations of visual and electrophysiological neurorecovery in humans with glaucoma is highly encouraging and motivates longer duration trials investigating bioenergetic neuroprotection.","['1 Ophthalmic Research Laboratories, University of Adelaide, Adelaide Health and Medical Sciences Building, North Terrace, Adelaide, SA, 5000, Australia.

In the retina, spontaneous activity comes in the form of retinal waves, comprised of three stages persisting from embryonic day 16 (E16) to eye opening at postnatal day 14 (P14). Though postnatal retinal waves have been well characterized, little is known about the spatiotemporal properties or the mechanisms mediating embryonic retinal waves, designated stage 1 waves. Using a custom-built macroscope to record spontaneous calcium transients from whole embryonic retinas, we show that stage 1 waves are initiated at several locations across the retina and propagate across a broad range of areas. Blocking gap junctions reduced the frequency and size of stage 1 waves, nearly abolishing them. Global blockade of nAChRs similarly nearly abolished stage 1 waves. Thus, stage 1 waves are mediated by a complex circuitry involving subtypes of nAChRs and gap junctions. Stage 1 waves in mice lacking the β2 subunit of the nAChRs (β2-nAChR-KO) persisted with altered propagation properties and were abolished by a gap junction blocker. To assay the impact of stage 1 waves on retinal development, we compared the spatial distribution of a subtype of retinal ganglion cells, intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs), which undergo a significant amount of cell death, in WT and β2-nAChR-KO mice. We found that the developmental decrease in ipRGC density is preserved between WT and β2-nAChR-KO mice, indicating that processes regulating ipRGC numbers and distributions are not influenced by spontaneous activity.","['1 Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, United States.', '2 Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, United States.', '3 School of Optometry, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, United States.']","Christiane Voufo, Andy Quaen Chen, Benjamin E Smith, Rongshan Yan, Marla B Feller, Alexandre Tiriac, ",eLife,2023,calcium imaging; embryonic; mouse; neuroscience; retina; spontaneous activity.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36790167
162,Super-resolution ophthalmoscopy: Virtually structured detection for resolution improvement in retinal imaging,"Quantitative retinal imaging is essential for advanced study and clinical management of eye diseases. However, spatial resolution of retinal imaging has been limited due to available numerical aperture and optical aberration of the ocular optics. Structured illumination microscopy has been established to break the diffraction-limit resolution in conventional light microscopy. However, practical implementation of structured illumination microscopy for in vivo ophthalmoscopy of the retina is challenging due to inevitable eye movements that can produce phase artifacts. Recently, we have demonstrated the feasibility of using virtually structured detection as one alternative to structured illumination microscopy for super-resolution imaging. By providing the flexibility of digital compensation of eye movements, the virtually structured detection provides a feasible, phase-artifact-free strategy to achieve super-resolution ophthalmoscopy. In this article, we summarize the technical rationale of virtually structured detection, and its implementations for super-resolution imaging of freshly isolated retinas, intact animals, and awake human subjects.","['1 Department of Bioengineering, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL 60607, USA.', '2 Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL 60612, USA.', '3 35034National Eye Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20814, USA.', '4 Janelia Research Campus, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Ashburn, VA 20147, USA.', '5 Department of Bioengineering, 7284University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98105, USA.']","Xincheng Yao, Rongwen Lu, Benquan Wang, Yiming Lu, Tae-Hoon Kim, ","Experimental biology and medicine (Maywood, N.J.)",NO_DATE,Retina; modulation transfer function; optical transfer function; photoreceptor; scanning laser ophthalmoscopy; super-resolution; virtually structured detection.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33243006
163,RNA-Seq Analysis Reveals an Essential Role of the Tyrosine Metabolic Pathway and Inflammation in Myopia-Induced Retinal Degeneration in Guinea Pigs,"Myopia is the second leading cause of visual impairment globally. Myopia can induce sight-threatening retinal degeneration and the underlying mechanism remains poorly defined. We generated a model of myopia-induced early-stage retinal degeneration in guinea pigs and investigated the mechanism of action. Methods: The form-deprivation-induced myopia (FDM) was induced in the right eyes of 2~3-week-old guinea pigs using a translucent balloon for 15 weeks. The left eye remained untreated and served as a self-control. Another group of untreated age-matched animals was used as naïve controls. The refractive error and ocular biometrics were measured at 3, 7, 9, 12 and 15 weeks post-FDM induction. Visual function was evaluated by electroretinography. Retinal neurons and synaptic structures were examined by confocal microscopy of immunolabelled retinal sections. The total RNAs were extracted from the retinas and processed for RNA sequencing analysis. Results: The FDM eyes presented a progressive axial length elongation and refractive error development. After 15 weeks of intervention, the average refractive power was -3.40 ± 1.85 D in the FDM eyes, +2.94 ± 0.59 D and +2.69 ± 0.56 D in the self-control and naïve control eyes, respectively. The a-wave amplitude was significantly lower in FDM eyes and these eyes had a significantly lower number of rods, secretagogin+ bipolar cells, and GABAergic amacrine cells in selected retinal areas. RNA-seq analysis showed that 288 genes were upregulated and 119 genes were downregulated in FDM retinas compared to naïve control retinas. In addition, 152 genes were upregulated and 12 were downregulated in FDM retinas compared to self-control retinas. The KEGG enrichment analysis showed that tyrosine metabolism, ABC transporters and inflammatory pathways were upregulated, whereas tight junction, lipid and glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis were downregulated in FDM eyes. Conclusions: The long-term (15-week) FDM in the guinea pig models induced an early-stage retinal degeneration. The dysregulation of the tyrosine metabolism and inflammatory pathways may contribute to the pathogenesis of myopia-induced retinal degeneration.","['1 Aier School of Ophthalmology, Central South University, Changsha 410000, China.', '2 Aier Eye Hospital, Changsha 410000, China.', '3 Aier School of Optometry and Vision Science, Hubei University of Science and Technology, Xianning 437100, China.', '4 Aier Institute of Optometry and Vision Science, Changsha 410000, China.', ""5 The Wellcome-Wolfson Institute for Experimental Medicine, School of Medicine, Dentistry and Biomedical Sciences, Queen's University Belfast, Belfast BT9 7BL, UK.""]","Ling Zeng, Xiaoning Li, Jian Liu, Hong Liu, Heping Xu, Zhikuan Yang, ",International journal of molecular sciences,2021,ABC transporter; RNA sequencing; animal model; complement cascade; form deprivation; glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis; lipid biosynthesis; myopic retinopathy.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34830490
164,A Neuromorphic Processing System With Spike-Driven SNN Processor for Wearable ECG Classification,"This paper presents a neuromorphic processing system with a spike-driven spiking neural network (SNN) processor design for always-on wearable electrocardiogram (ECG) classification. In the proposed system, the ECG signal is captured by level crossing (LC) sampling, achieving native temporal coding with single-bit data representation, which is directly fed into an SNN in an event-driven manner. A hardware-aware spatio-temporal backpropagation (STBP) is suggested as the training scheme to adapt to the LC-based data representation and to generate lightweight SNN models. Such a training scheme diminishes the firing rate of the network with little plenty of classification accuracy loss, thus reducing the switching activity of the circuits for low-power operation. A specialized SNN processor is designed with the spike-driven processing flow and hierarchical memory access scheme. Validated with field programmable gate arrays (FPGA) and evaluated in 40 nm CMOS technology for application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) design, the SNN processor can achieve 98.22% classification accuracy on the MIT-BIH database for 5-category classification, with an energy efficiency of 0.75 μJ/classification.",NO_AFFILIATIONS,"Haoming Chu, Yulong Yan, Leijing Gan, Hao Jia, Liyu Qian, Yuxiang Huan, Lirong Zheng, Zhuo Zou, ",IEEE transactions on biomedical circuits and systems,NO_DATE,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35802543
165,Towards optogenetic vision restoration with high resolution,"In many cases of inherited retinal degenerations, ganglion cells are spared despite photoreceptor cell death, making it possible to stimulate them to restore visual function. Several studies have shown that it is possible to express an optogenetic protein in ganglion cells and make them light sensitive, a promising strategy to restore vision. However the spatial resolution of optogenetically-reactivated retinas has rarely been measured, especially in the primate. Since the optogenetic protein is also expressed in axons, it is unclear if these neurons will only be sensitive to the stimulation of a small region covering their somas and dendrites, or if they will also respond to any stimulation overlapping with their axon, dramatically impairing spatial resolution. Here we recorded responses of mouse and macaque retinas to random checkerboard patterns following an in vivo optogenetic therapy. We show that optogenetically activated ganglion cells are each sensitive to a small region of visual space. A simple model based on this small receptive field predicted accurately their responses to complex stimuli. From this model, we simulated how the entire population of light sensitive ganglion cells would respond to letters of different sizes. We then estimated the maximal acuity expected by a patient, assuming it could make an optimal use of the information delivered by this reactivated retina. The obtained acuity is above the limit of legal blindness. Our model also makes interesting predictions on how acuity might vary upon changing the therapeutic strategy, assuming an optimal use of the information present in the retinal activity. Optogenetic therapy could thus potentially lead to high resolution vision, under conditions that our model helps to determinine.","['1 Sorbonne Université, INSERM, CNRS, Institut de la Vision, 17 rue Moreau, F-75012 Paris, France.']","Ulisse Ferrari, Stéphane Deny, Abhishek Sengupta, Romain Caplette, Francesco Trapani, José-Alain Sahel, Deniz Dalkara, Serge Picaud, Jens Duebel, Olivier Marre, ",PLoS computational biology,2020,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32667921
166,RAt-CapsNet: A Deep Learning Network Utilizing Attention and Regional Information for Abnormality Detection in Wireless Capsule Endoscopy,"Background: The emergence of wireless capsule endoscopy (WCE) has presented a viable non-invasive mean of identifying gastrointestinal diseases in the field of clinical gastroenterology. However, to overcome its extended time of manual inspection, a computer aided automatic detection system is getting vast popularity. In this case, major challenges are low resolution and lack of regional context in images extracted from WCE videos. Methods: For tackling these challenges, in this paper a convolution neural network (CNN) based architecture, namely RAt-CapsNet, is proposed that reliably employs regional information and attention mechanism to classify abnormalities from WCE video data. The proposed RAt-CapsNet consists of two major pipelines: Compression Pipeline and Regional Correlative Pipeline. In the compression pipeline, an encoder module is designed using a Volumetric Attention Mechanism which provides 3D enhancement to feature maps using spatial domain condensation as well as channel-wise filtering for preserving relevant structural information of images. On the other hand, the regional correlative pipeline consists of Pyramid Feature Extractor which operates on image driven feature vectors to generalize and propagate local relationships of pixels from WCE abnormalities with respect to the normal healthy surrounding. The feature vectors generated by the pipelines are then accumulated to formulate a classification standpoint. Results: Promising computational accuracy of mean 98.51% in binary class and over 95.65% in multi-class are obtained through extensive experimentation on a highly unbalanced public dataset with over 47 thousand labelled. Conclusion: This outcome in turn supports the efficacy of the proposed methodology as a noteworthy WCE abnormality detection as well as diagnostic system.","['1 Department of Electrical and Electronic EngineeringBangladesh University of Engineering and Technology Dhaka 1000 Bangladesh.', '2 Department of Electrical EngineeringThe University of Texas at Dallas Richardson TX 75080 USA.']","Md Jahin Alam, Rifat Bin Rashid, Shaikh Anowarul Fattah, Mohammad Saquib, ",IEEE journal of translational engineering in health and medicine,2022,GI tract; Wireless capsule endoscopy; attention mechanism; deep CNN; pyramid.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36032311
167,Nanotube-like processes facilitate material transfer between photoreceptors,"Neuronal communication is typically mediated via synapses and gap junctions. New forms of intercellular communication, including nanotubes (NTs) and extracellular vesicles (EVs), have been described for non-neuronal cells, but their role in neuronal communication is not known. Recently, transfer of cytoplasmic material between donor and host neurons (""material transfer"") was shown to occur after photoreceptor transplantation. The cellular mechanism(s) underlying this surprising finding are unknown. Here, using transplantation, primary neuronal cultures and the generation of chimeric retinae, we show for the first time that mammalian photoreceptor neurons can form open-end NT-like processes. These processes permit the transfer of cytoplasmic and membrane-bound molecules in culture and after transplantation and can mediate gain-of-function in the acceptor cells. Rarely, organelles were also observed to transfer. Strikingly, use of chimeric retinae revealed that material transfer can occur between photoreceptors in the intact adult retina. Conversely, while photoreceptors are capable of releasing EVs, at least in culture, these are taken up by glia and not by retinal neurons. Our findings provide the first evidence of functional NT-like processes forming between sensory neurons in culture and in vivo.","['1 University College London Institute of Ophthalmology, London, UK.', ""2 Centre for Cell and Gene Therapy, King's College London, Guy's Hospital, London, UK."", '3 Kellogg Eye Center, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.']","Aikaterini A Kalargyrou, Mark Basche, Aura Hare, Emma L West, Alexander J Smith, Robin R Ali, Rachael A Pearson, ",EMBO reports,2021,extracellular vesicle; intercellular communication; material transfer; photoreceptor transplantation; tunnelling nanotube.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34494703
168,Accumulation of systematic TPM1 mediates inflammation and neuronal remodeling by phosphorylating PKA and regulating the FABP5/NF-κB signaling pathway in the retina of aged mice,"The molecular mechanisms underlying functional decline during normal brain aging are poorly understood. Here, we identified the actin-associated protein tropomyosin 1 (TPM1) as a new systemic pro-aging factor associated with function deficits in normal aging retinas. Heterochronic parabiosis and blood plasma treatment confirmed that systemic factors regulated age-related inflammatory responses and the ectopic dendritic sprouting of rod bipolar (RBC) and horizontal (HC) cells in the aging retina. Proteomic analysis revealed that TPM1 was a potential systemic molecule underlying structural and functional deficits in the aging retina. Recombinant TPM1 protein administration accelerated the activation of glial cells, the dendritic sprouting of RBCs and HCs and functional decline in the retina of young mice, whereas anti-TPM1 neutralizing antibody treatment ameliorated age-related structural and function changes in the retina of aged mice. Old mouse plasma (OMP) induced glial cell activation and the dendritic outgrowth of RBCs and HCs in young mice, and yet TMP1-depleted OMP failed to reproduce the similar effect in young mice. These results confirmed that TPM1 was a systemic pro-aging factor. Moreover, we demonstrated that systematic TPM1 was an immune-related molecule, which elicited endogenous TPM1 expression and inflammation by phosphorylating PKA and regulating FABP5/NF-κB signaling pathway in normal aging retinas. Interestingly, we observed TPM1 upregulation and the ectopic dendritic sprouting of RBCs and HCs in young mouse models of Alzheimer's disease, indicating a potential role of TPM1 in age-related neurodegenerative diseases. Our data indicate that TPM1 could be targeted for combating the aging process.","['1 School of Optometry, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Kowloon, Hong Kong.', '2 The State Key Laboratory of Brain and Cognitive Sciences, The University of Hong Kong, Pok Fu Lam, Hong Kong.']","Rong Li, Yuxiang Liang, Bin Lin, ",Aging cell,NO_DATE,aging; dendritic sprouting; inflammation; parabiosis; retina; tropomyosin 1.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35148456
169,Nucleome Dynamics during Retinal Development,"More than 8,000 genes are turned on or off as progenitor cells produce the 7 classes of retinal cell types during development. Thousands of enhancers are also active in the developing retinae, many having features of cell- and developmental stage-specific activity. We studied dynamic changes in the 3D chromatin landscape important for precisely orchestrated changes in gene expression during retinal development by ultra-deep in situ Hi-C analysis on murine retinae. We identified developmental-stage-specific changes in chromatin compartments and enhancer-promoter interactions. We developed a machine learning-based algorithm to map euchromatin and heterochromatin domains genome-wide and overlaid it with chromatin compartments identified by Hi-C. Single-cell ATAC-seq and RNA-seq were integrated with our Hi-C and previous ChIP-seq data to identify cell- and developmental-stage-specific super-enhancers (SEs). We identified a bipolar neuron-specific core regulatory circuit SE upstream of Vsx2, whose deletion in mice led to the loss of bipolar neurons.","[""1 Department of Developmental Neurobiology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105, USA."", ""2 Department of Computational Biology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105, USA."", ""3 Cytogenetics Shared Resource, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105, USA."", '4 Department of Ophthalmology, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, TN 38163, USA.', ""5 Cellular Imaging Shared Resource, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105, USA."", ""6 Department of Cell and Molecular Biology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105, USA."", ""7 Department of Computational Biology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105, USA.

170,Cyclosporine A Protects Retinal Explants against Hypoxia,"The retina is a complex neurological tissue and is extremely sensitive to an insufficient supply of oxygen. Hypoxia plays a major role in several retinal diseases, and often results in the loss of cells that are essential for vision. Cyclosporine A (CsA) is a widely used immunosuppressive drug. Furthermore, treatment with CsA has neuroprotective effects in several neurologic disorders. No data are currently available on the tolerated concentration of CsA when applied to the retina. To reveal the most effective dose, retinal explants from rat eyes were exposed to different CsA concentrations (1-9 µg/mL). Immunohistochemistry with brain-specific homeobox/POU domain protein 3a (Brn3a) and TUNEL staining was performed to determine the percentage of total and apoptotic retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), as well as the responses of micro- and macroglial cells. Furthermore, optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans were performed to measure the changes in retinal thickness, and recordings with multielectrode array (MEA) were performed to evaluate spontaneous RGC spiking. To examine the neuroprotective effects, retinas were subjected to a hypoxic insult by placing them in a nitrogen-streamed hypoxic chamber prior to CsA treatment. In the biocompatibility tests, the different CsA concentrations had no negative effect on RGCs and microglia. Neuroprotective effects after a hypoxic insult on RGCs was demonstrated at a concentration of 9 µg/mL CsA. CsA counteracted the hypoxia-induced loss of RGCs, reduced the percentage of TUNEL+ RGCs, and prevented a decrease in retinal thickness. Taken together, the results of this study suggest that CsA can effectively protect RGCs from hypoxia, and the administered concentrations were well tolerated. Further in vivo studies are needed to determine whether local CsA treatment may be a suitable option for hypoxic retinal diseases.","['1 Centre for Ophthalmology Tübingen, University Eye Hospital Tübingen, 72076 Tübingen, Germany.', '2 Clinic for Ophthalmology, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE), 20246 Hamburg, Germany.', '3 Department of Ophthalmology, Klinikum Stuttgart, 70174 Stuttgart, Germany.', '4 NMI Natural and Medical Sciences Institute, University of Tübingen, 72770 Reutlingen, Germany.', '5 Institute of Electrodynamics, Microwave and Circuit Engineering, TU Wien, 1040 Vienna, Austria.']","Sven Schnichels, Maximilian Schultheiss, Patricia Klemm, Matthias Blak, Thoralf Herrmann, Marion Melchinger, Karl-Ulrich Bartz-Schmidt, Marina Löscher, Günther Zeck, Martin Stehphan Spitzer, José Hurst, ",International journal of molecular sciences,2021,cyclosporine A; hypoxia; ischemia; neuroprotection; retinal ganglion cells.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34638537
171,An optimized protocol for retina single-cell RNA sequencing,"Purpose:
        
      
      Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a powerful technique used to explore gene expression at the single cell level. However, appropriate preparation of samples is essential to obtain the most information out of this transformative technology. Generating high-quality single-cell suspensions from the retina is critical to preserve the native expression profile that will ensure meaningful transcriptome data analysis. Methods:
        
      
      We modified the conditions for rapid and optimal dissociation of retina sample preparation. We also included additional filtering steps in data analysis for retinal scRNA-seq. Results:
        
      
      We report a gentle method for dissociation of the mouse retina that minimizes cell death and preserves cell morphology. This protocol also results in detection of higher transcriptional complexity. In addition, the modified computational pipeline leads to better-quality single-cell RNA-sequencing data in retina samples. We also demonstrate the advantages and limitations of using fresh versus frozen retinas to prepare cell or nuclei suspensions for scRNA-seq. Conclusions:

172,Quantum superposition inspired spiking neural network,"Despite advances in artificial intelligence models, neural networks still cannot achieve human performance, partly due to differences in how information is encoded and processed compared with human brain. Information in an artificial neural network (ANN) is represented using a statistical method and processed as a fitting function, enabling handling of structural patterns in image, text, and speech processing. However, substantial changes to the statistical characteristics of the data, for example, reversing the background of an image, dramatically reduce the performance. Here, we propose a quantum superposition spiking neural network (QS-SNN) inspired by quantum mechanisms and phenomena in the brain, which can handle reversal of image background color. The QS-SNN incorporates quantum theory with brain-inspired spiking neural network models from a computational perspective, resulting in more robust performance compared with traditional ANN models, especially when processing noisy inputs.

174,Quantization Framework for Fast Spiking Neural Networks,"Compared with artificial neural networks (ANNs), spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer additional temporal dynamics with the compromise of lower information transmission rates through the use of spikes. When using an ANN-to-SNN conversion technique there is a direct link between the activation bit precision of the artificial neurons and the time required by the spiking neurons to represent the same bit precision. This implicit link suggests that techniques used to reduce the activation bit precision of ANNs, such as quantization, can help shorten the inference latency of SNNs. However, carrying ANN quantization knowledge over to SNNs is not straightforward, as there are many fundamental differences between them. Here we propose a quantization framework for fast SNNs (QFFS) to overcome these difficulties, providing a method to build SNNs with enhanced latency and reduced loss of accuracy relative to the baseline ANN model. In this framework, we promote the compatibility of ANN information quantization techniques with SNNs, and suppress ""occasional noise"" to minimize accuracy loss. The resulting SNNs overcome the accuracy degeneration observed previously in SNNs with a limited number of time steps and achieve an accuracy of 70.18% on ImageNet within 8 time steps. This is the first demonstration that SNNs built by ANN-to-SNN conversion can achieve a similar latency to SNNs built by direct training.","['1 Advanced Processor Technologies (APT) Group, Department of Computer Science, The University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom.', '2 Beijing Academy of Artificial Intelligence, Beijing, China.', '3 National Biomedical Imaging Center, Peking University, Beijing, China.']","Chen Li, Lei Ma, Steve Furber, ",Frontiers in neuroscience,2022,ANN-to-SNN conversion; fast spiking neural networks; inference latency; occasional noise; quantization; spiking neural networks.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35928011

This chapter provides a brief overview of mitochondrial structure and function, summarizes evidence for mitochondrial defects in AMD, and highlights the potential ramifications of these defects on retinal health and function. Discussion of mitochondrial haplogroups and their association with AMD brings to light how mitochondrial genetics can influence disease outcome. As one of the most metabolically active tissues in the human body, there is strong evidence that disruption in key metabolic pathways contributes to AMD pathology. The section on retinal metabolism reviews cell-specific metabolic differences and how the metabolic interdependence of each retinal cell type creates a unique ecosystem that is disrupted in the diseased retina.

176,Wnt Signaling in Inner Blood-Retinal Barrier Maintenance,"The retina is a light-sensing ocular tissue that sends information to the brain to enable vision. The blood-retinal barrier (BRB) contributes to maintaining homeostasis in the retinal microenvironment by selectively regulating flux of molecules between systemic circulation and the retina. Maintaining such physiological balance is fundamental to visual function by facilitating the delivery of nutrients and oxygen and for protection from blood-borne toxins. The inner BRB (iBRB), composed mostly of inner retinal vasculature, controls substance exchange mainly via transportation processes between (paracellular) and through (transcellular) the retinal microvascular endothelium. Disruption of iBRB, characterized by retinal edema, is observed in many eye diseases and disturbs the physiological quiescence in the retina's extracellular space, resulting in vision loss. Consequently, understanding the mechanisms of iBRB formation, maintenance, and breakdown is pivotal to discovering potential targets to restore function to compromised physiological barriers. These unraveled targets can also inform potential drug delivery strategies across the BRB and the blood-brain barrier into retinas and brain tissues, respectively. This review summarizes mechanistic insights into the development and maintenance of iBRB in health and disease, with a specific focus on the Wnt signaling pathway and its regulatory role in both paracellular and transcellular transport across the retinal vascular endothelium.","[""1 Department of Ophthalmology, Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.""]","Felix Yemanyi, Kiran Bora, Alexandra K Blomfield, Zhongxiao Wang, Jing Chen, ",International journal of molecular sciences,2021,Wnt signaling; blood–retinal barrier; endothelial cells; paracellular transport; transcytosis.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34769308

Light-induced electrical activity is associated with a redistribution of ions, which affects the energy demand and results in a change in metabolism. Light-induced metabolic changes are expected to be different in distal and proximal retina due to differences in the light responses of different retinal cells. Extracellular K+ concentration ([K+]o) is a reliable indicator of local electrophysiological activity, and the purpose of this work was to compare [K+]o changes evoked by steady and flickering light in distal and proximal retina. Data were obtained from isolated mouse (C57Bl/6J) retinae. Double-barreled K+-selective microelectrodes were used to simultaneously record [K+]o and local ERGs. In the distal retina, photoreceptor hyperpolarization led to suppression of ion transfer, a decrease in [K+]o by 0.3-0.5 mM, reduced energy demand, and, as previously shown in vivo, decreased metabolism. Flickering light had the same effect on [K+]o in the distal retina as steady light of equivalent illumination. The conductance and voltage changes in postreceptor neurons are cell-specific, but the overall effect of steady light in the proximal retina is excitation, which is reflected in a [K+]o increase there (by a maximum of 0.2 mM). In steady light the [K+]o increase lasts only 1-2 s, but a sustained [K+]o increase is evoked by flickering light. A squarewave low frequency (1 Hz) flicker of photopic intensity produced the largest increases in [K+]o. Judging by measurements of [K+]o, steady illumination decreases energy metabolism in the distal retina, but not in the proximal retina (except for the first few seconds). Flickering light evokes the same decrease in the distal retina, but also evokes a sustained [K+]o increase in the proximal retina, suggesting an increase of metabolic demand there, especially at 1 Hz, when neurons of both on- and off-pathways appear to contribute maximally. This proximal retinal metabolic response to flicker correlates to the increase in blood flow during flicker that constitutes neurovascular coupling.","['1 Department of Biomedical Engineering, 2145 Sheridan Road, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, 60208-3107, United States.

179,Orientation-Selective Retinal Circuits in Vertebrates,"Visual information is already processed in the retina before it is transmitted to higher visual centers in the brain. This includes the extraction of salient features from visual scenes, such as motion directionality or contrast, through neurons belonging to distinct neural circuits. Some retinal neurons are tuned to the orientation of elongated visual stimuli. Such 'orientation-selective' neurons are present in the retinae of most, if not all, vertebrate species analyzed to date, with species-specific differences in frequency and degree of tuning. In some cases, orientation-selective neurons have very stereotyped functional and morphological properties suggesting that they represent distinct cell types. In this review, we describe the retinal cell types underlying orientation selectivity found in various vertebrate species, and highlight their commonalities and differences. In addition, we discuss recent studies that revealed the cellular, synaptic and circuit mechanisms at the basis of retinal orientation selectivity. Finally, we outline the significance of these findings in shaping our current understanding of how this fundamental neural computation is implemented in the visual systems of vertebrates.","[""1 Centre for Developmental Neurobiology, King's College London, London, United Kingdom."", ""2 MRC Centre for Neurodevelopmental Disorders, King's College London, London, United Kingdom.""]","Paride Antinucci, Robert Hindges, ",Frontiers in neural circuits,2018,amacrine cell; cat; mouse; orientation selectivity; primate; rabbit; retinal ganglion cell; zebrafish.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29467629
180,Models developed for spiking neural networks,"Emergence of deep neural networks (DNNs) has raised enormous attention towards artificial neural networks (ANNs) once again. They have become the state-of-the-art models and have won different machine learning challenges. Although these networks are inspired by the brain, they lack biological plausibility, and they have structural differences compared to the brain. Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have been around for a long time, and they have been investigated to understand the dynamics of the brain. However, their application in real-world and complicated machine learning tasks were limited. Recently, they have shown great potential in solving such tasks. Due to their energy efficiency and temporal dynamics there are many promises in their future development. In this work, we reviewed the structures and performances of SNNs on image classification tasks. The comparisons illustrate that these networks show great capabilities for more complicated problems. Furthermore, the simple learning rules developed for SNNs, such as STDP and R-STDP, can be a potential alternative to replace the backpropagation algorithm used in DNNs.•Different building blocks of spiking neural networks are explained in this work.•Developed models for SNNs are introduced based on their characteristics and building blocks.","['1 School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, College of Engineering, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran.', '2 School of Cognitive Sciences, Institute for Research in Fundamental Sciences (IPM), Tehran, Iran.']","Shahriar Rezghi Shirsavar, Abdol-Hossein Vahabie, Mohammad-Reza A Dehaqani, ",MethodsX,2023,ANN-to-SNN; Backpropagation; Biological plausibility; Literature review; R-STDP; STDP; Spiking neural network.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37077894
181,Automated Classification of Apoptosis in Phase Contrast Microscopy Using Capsule Network,"Automatic and accurate classification of apoptosis, or programmed cell death, will facilitate cell biology research. The state-of-the-art approaches in apoptosis classification use deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, these networks are not efficient in encoding the part-whole relationships, thus requiring a large number of training samples to achieve robust generalization. This paper proposes an efficient variant of capsule networks (CapsNets) as an alternative to CNNs. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed CapsNets achieve competitive performances in target cell apoptosis classification, while significantly outperforming CNNs when the number of training samples is small. To utilize temporal information within microscopy videos, we propose a recurrent CapsNet constructed by stacking a CapsNet and a bi-directional long short-term recurrent structure. Our experiments show that when considering temporal constraints, the recurrent CapsNet achieves 93.8% accuracy and makes significantly more consistent prediction than NNs.",NO_AFFILIATIONS,"Aryan Mobiny, Hengyang Lu, Hien V Nguyen, Badrinath Roysam, Navin Varadarajan, ",IEEE transactions on medical imaging,NO_DATE,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31135355
182,Online Spatio-Temporal Learning in Deep Neural Networks,"Biological neural networks are equipped with an inherent capability to continuously adapt through online learning. This aspect remains in stark contrast to learning with error backpropagation through time (BPTT) that involves offline computation of the gradients due to the need to unroll the network through time. Here, we present an alternative online learning algorithm framework for deep recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and spiking neural networks (SNNs), called online spatio-temporal learning (OSTL). It is based on insights from biology and proposes the clear separation of spatial and temporal gradient components. For shallow SNNs, OSTL is gradient equivalent to BPTT enabling for the first time online training of SNNs with BPTT-equivalent gradients. In addition, the proposed formulation unveils a class of SNN architectures trainable online at low time complexity. Moreover, we extend OSTL to a generic form, applicable to a wide range of network architectures, including networks comprising long short-term memory (LSTM) and gated recurrent units (GRUs). We demonstrate the operation of our algorithm framework on various tasks from language modeling to speech recognition and obtain results on par with the BPTT baselines.",NO_AFFILIATIONS,"Thomas Bohnstingl, Stanislaw Wozniak, Angeliki Pantazi, Evangelos Eleftheriou, ",IEEE transactions on neural networks and learning systems,2022,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35294357
183,Melanopsin phototransduction: beyond canonical cascades,"Melanopsin is a visual pigment that is expressed in a small subset of intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs). It is involved in regulating non-image forming visual behaviors, such as circadian photoentrainment and the pupillary light reflex, while also playing a role in many aspects of image-forming vision, such as contrast sensitivity. Melanopsin was initially discovered in the melanophores of the skin of the frog Xenopus, and subsequently found in a subset of ganglion cells in rat, mouse and primate retinas. ipRGCs were initially thought to be a single retinal ganglion cell population, and melanopsin was thought to activate a single, invertebrate-like Gq/transient receptor potential canonical (TRPC)-based phototransduction cascade within these cells. However, in the 20 years since the discovery of melanopsin, our knowledge of this visual pigment and ipRGCs has expanded dramatically. Six ipRGC subtypes have now been identified in the mouse, each with unique morphological, physiological and functional properties. Multiple subtypes have also been identified in other species, suggesting that this cell type diversity is a general feature of the ipRGC system. This diversity has led to a renewed interest in melanopsin phototransduction that may not follow the canonical Gq/TRPC cascade in the mouse or in the plethora of other organisms that express the melanopsin photopigment. In this Review, we discuss recent findings and discoveries that have challenged the prevailing view of melanopsin phototransduction as a single pathway that influences solely non-image forming functions.","['1 Department of Neurobiology, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL 60208, USA.', '2 Interdisciplinary Biological Sciences Program, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL 60208, USA.', '3 University of Maryland Baltimore County, Department of Biological Sciences, Baltimore, MD 21250, USA.', '4 Section on Light and Circadian Rhythms (SLCR), National Institute of Mental Health, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.', '5 Department of Ophthalmology, Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL 60611, USA.']","Ely Contreras, Alexis P Nobleman, Phyllis R Robinson, Tiffany M Schmidt, ",The Journal of experimental biology,2021,Cascades; GPCR; Melanopsin; Phototransduction; Retina; Signaling; Vision.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34842918
184,MICaps: Multi-instance capsule network for machine inspection of Munro's microabscess,"Munro's Microabscess (MM) is the diagnostic hallmark of psoriasis. Neutrophil detection in the Stratum Corneum (SC) of the skin epidermis is an integral part of MM detection in skin biopsy. The microscopic inspection of skin biopsy is a tedious task and staining variations in skin histopathology often hinder human performance to differentiate neutrophils from skin keratinocytes. Motivated from this, we propose a computational framework that can assist human experts and reduce potential errors in diagnosis. The framework first segments the SC layer, and multiple patches are sampled from the segmented regions which are classified to detect neutrophils. Both UNet and CapsNet are used for segmentation and classification. Experiments show that of the two choices, CapsNet, owing to its robustness towards better hierarchical object representation and localisation ability, appears as a better candidate for both segmentation and classification tasks and hence, we termed our framework as MICaps. The training algorithm explores both minimisation of Dice Loss and Focal Loss and makes a comparative study between the two. The proposed framework is validated with our in-house dataset consisting of 290 skin biopsy images. Two different experiments are considered. Under the first protocol, only 3-fold cross-validation is done to directly compare the current results with the state-of-the-art ones. Next, the performance of the system on a held-out data set is reported. The experimental results show that MICaps improves the state-of-the-art diagnosis performance by 3.27% (maximum) and reduces the number of model parameters by 50%.","['1 National Library of Medicine, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.

185,Biology and molecular interactions of Parastagonospora nodorum blotch of wheat,"Parastagonospora nodorum is one of the important necrotrophic pathogens of wheat which causes severe economical loss to crop yield. So far, a number of effectors of Parastagonospora nodorum origin and their target interacting genes on the host plant have been characterized. Since targeting effector-sensitive gene carefully can be helpful in breeding for resistance. Therefore, constant efforts are required to further characterize the effectors, their interacting genes, and underlying biochemical pathways. Furthermore, to develop effective counter-strategies against emerging diseases, continuous efforts are required to determine the qualitative resistance that demands to screen of diverse genotypes for host resistance. Stagonospora nodorum blotch also refers to as Stagonospora glume blotch and leaf is caused by Parastagonospora nodorum. The pathogen deploys necrotrophic effectors for the establishment and development on wheat plants. The necrotrophic effectors and their interaction with host receptors lead to the establishment of infection on leaves and extensive lesions formation which either results in host cell death or suppression/activation of host defence mechanisms. The wheat Stagonospora nodorum interaction involves a set of nine host gene-necrotrophic effector interactions. Out of these, Snn1-SnTox1, Tsn1-SnToxA and Snn-SnTox3 are one of the most studied interaction, due to its role in the suppression of reactive oxygen species production, regulating the cytokinin content through ethylene-dependent wayduring initial infection stage. Further, although the molecular basis is not fully unveiled, these effectors regulate the redox state and influence the ethylene biosynthesis in infected wheat plants. Here, we have discussed the biology of the wheat pathogen Parastagonospora nodorum, role of its necrotrophic effectors and their interacting sensitivity genes on the redox state, how they hijack the resistance mechanisms, hormonal regulated immunity and other signalling pathways in susceptible wheat plants. The information generated from effectors and their corresponding sensitivity genes and other biological processes could be utilized effectively for disease management strategies.","['1 Division of Plant Pathology, ICAR-Indian Agricultural Research Institute, New Delhi, 110012, India.', '2 University Centre for Research and Development, Chandigarh University, Gharuan, 140413, Punjab, India. ankvivek@gmail.com.', '3 Crop Improvement Division, ICAR-Vivekananda Parvatiya Krishi Anusandhan Sansthan, Almora, Uttarakhand, India.', '4 College of Horticulture and Forestry, Neri, Dr YS Parmar University of Horticulture and Forestry, Solan, Hamirpur, 177 001, India.', '5 Department of Plant Pathology, CSK HPKV Palampur, Palampur, 176062, Himachal Pradesh, India.']","Shabnam Katoch, Vivek Sharma, Devender Sharma, Richa Salwan, S K Rana, ",Planta,2021,Biotic; Effectors; Necrotrophic; Pathogen; Resistance; Stress.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34914013
186,Anticipation and negative group delay in a retina,"The mechanism of negative group delay (NGD) is used to understand the anticipatory capability of a retina. Experiments with retinas from bullfrogs are performed to compare with the predictions of the NGD model. In particular, whole field stochastic stimulations with various autocorrelation times are used to probe anticipatory responses from the retina. We find that the NGD model can reproduce essential features of experimental observations characterized by the cross correlations between the stimulation and the retinal responses. Experiments with dark light pulse stimulations further support the NGD mechanism, with the retina producing time-advanced pulse responses. However, no time-advanced pulse responses are produced by bright pulses. Counterintuitively, the NGD model shows that it is the delay in the system which gives rise to anticipation because of the negative feedback adaptation mechanism.","['1 Department of Physics, National Central University, Chungli District, Taoyuan 320, Taiwan, Republic of China.', '2 Institute of Physics, Academia Sinica, Nankang, Taipei 115, Taiwan, Republic of China.']","Po-Yu Chou, Jo-Fan Chien, Kevin Sean Chen, Yu-Ting Huang, Chun-Chung Chen, C K Chan, ",Physical review.

187,"Microglia in the Retina: Roles in Development, Maturity, and Disease","Microglia, the primary resident immune cell type, constitute a key population of glia in the retina. Recent evidence indicates that microglia play significant functional roles in the retina at different life stages. During development, retinal microglia regulate neuronal survival by exerting trophic influences and influencing programmed cell death. During adulthood, ramified microglia in the plexiform layers interact closely with synapses to maintain synaptic structure and function that underlie the retina's electrophysiological response to light. Under pathological conditions, retinal microglia participate in potentiating neurodegeneration in diseases such as glaucoma, retinitis pigmentosa, and age-related neurodegeneration by producing proinflammatory neurotoxic cytokines and removing living neurons via phagocytosis. Modulation of pathogenic microglial activation states and effector mechanisms has been linked to neuroprotection in animal models of retinal diseases. These findings have led to the design of early proof-of-concept clinical trials with microglial modulation as a therapeutic strategy.","['1 Unit on Neuron-Glia Interactions in Retinal Disease, National Eye Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA; email: sean.silverman@nih.gov , wongw@nih.gov.']","Sean M Silverman, Wai T Wong, ",Annual review of vision science,2018,development; disease; homeostasis; microglia; retina; therapy.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29852094
188,A Co-Designed Neuromorphic Chip With Compact (17.9K F2) and Weak Neuron Number-Dependent Neuron/Synapse Modules,"Many efforts have been made to improve the neuron integration efficiency on neuromorphic chips, such as using emerging memory devices and shrinking CMOS technology nodes. However, in the fully connected (FC) neuromorphic core, increasing the number of neurons will lead to a square increase in synapse & dendrite costs and a high-slope linear increase in soma costs, resulting in an explosive growth of core hardware costs. We propose a co-designed neuromorphic core (SRCcore) based on the quantized spiking neural network (SNN) technology and compact chip design methodology. The cost of the neuron/synapse module in SRCcore weakly depends on the neuron number, which effectively relieves the growth pressure of the core area caused by increasing the neuron number. In the proposed BICS chip based on SRCcore, although the neuron/synapse module implements 1∼16 times of neurons and 1∼66 times of synapses, it only costs an area of 1.79 × 107 F2, which is 7.9%∼38.6% of that in previous works. Based on the weight quantization strategy matched with SRCcore, quantized SNNs achieve 0.05%∼2.19% higher accuracy than previous works, thus supporting the design and application of SRCcore. Finally, a cross-modeling application is demonstrated based on the chip.

189,Benchmarking Neuromorphic Hardware and Its Energy Expenditure,"We propose and discuss a platform overarching benchmark suite for neuromorphic hardware. This suite covers benchmarks from low-level characterization to high-level application evaluation using benchmark specific metrics. With this rather broad approach we are able to compare various hardware systems including mixed-signal and fully digital neuromorphic architectures. Selected benchmarks are discussed and results for several target platforms are presented revealing characteristic differences between the various systems. Furthermore, a proposed energy model allows to combine benchmark performance metrics with energy efficiency. This model enables the prediction of the energy expenditure of a network on a target system without actually having access to it. To quantify the efficiency gap between neuromorphics and the biological paragon of the human brain, the energy model is used to estimate the energy required for a full brain simulation. This reveals that current neuromorphic systems are at least four orders of magnitude less efficient. It is argued, that even with a modern fabrication process, two to three orders of magnitude are remaining. Finally, for selected benchmarks the performance and efficiency of the neuromorphic solution is compared to standard approaches.","['1 Technical Faculty, Bielefeld University, Bielefeld, Germany.']","Christoph Ostrau, Christian Klarhorst, Michael Thies, Ulrich Rückert, ",Frontiers in neuroscience,2022,benchmark; deep neural network (DNN); energy model; neuromorphic hardware; spiking neural network (SNN).,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35720731

We developed light-sensitive human retinal organoids with multiple nuclear and synaptic layers and functional synapses. We sequenced the RNA of 285,441 single cells from these organoids at seven developmental time points and from the periphery, fovea, pigment epithelium and choroid of light-responsive adult human retinas, and performed histochemistry. Cell types in organoids matured in vitro to a stable ""developed"" state at a rate similar to human retina development in vivo. Transcriptomes of organoid cell types converged toward the transcriptomes of adult peripheral retinal cell types. Expression of disease-associated genes was cell-type-specific in adult retina, and cell-type specificity was retained in organoids. We implicate unexpected cell types in diseases such as macular degeneration.

Many aspects of the retina's development and the molecular events in the human light-sensing system have been previously unveiled. However, there is limited information about regulatory networks governing the transitional stages during retina development. To address this issue, we have studied the transcriptome dynamics of mice-derived retinal organoid development in 10 successive time-points, from stem cell to functional retina. For the first time, we have identified the main modules of genes related to different stages of development and predicted all possible transcription factors. A major shift in the transcriptome occurs during the transition of cells from D0 to D10 and again at the late stages of retina development. Transcription, nervous system development, cell cycle, neurotransmitter transport, glycosylation, and lipid metabolisms are the most important biological processes during retina development. Altogether, we have identified and reported 15 TFs, including Irx2, Irx3, Lmo2, Tead2, Tbx20, and Zeb1, which are potentially involved in the regulation of retinal organoid development.

However, expression regulation and therapeutic potential of cGAS and STING are not explored in retina under dry AMD pathogenic conditions. Our analysis shows upregulated STING RNA and increased chromatin accessibility around cGAS and STING promoters in macular retinas from dry AMD patients. cGAS-STING activation was detected in oxidative stress-induced mouse retina degeneration, accompanied with cytosolic leakage of damaged DNA in photoreceptors. Pharmaceutical or genetic approaches indicates STING promotes retina inflammation and degeneration upon oxidative damage. Drug screening reveals that BRD4 inhibitor JQ1 reduces cGAS-STING activation, inflammation and photoreceptor degeneration in the injured retina. BRD4 inhibition epigenetically suppresses STING transcription, and promotes autophagy-dependent cytosolic DNA clearance. Together, our results show that activation of cGAS-STING in retina may present pivotal innate immunity response in GA pathogenesis, whereas inhibition of cGAS-STING signaling by JQ1 could serve as a potential therapeutic strategy.","['1 State Key Laboratory of Ophthalmology, Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, 510060, Guangdong, China.', '2 State Key Laboratory of Ophthalmology, Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, 510060, Guangdong, China. dwli1688@hotmail.com.', '3 State Key Laboratory of Ophthalmology, Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, 510060, Guangdong, China. gonglili@gzzoc.com.']","Ming Zou, Qin Ke, Qian Nie, Ruili Qi, Xingfei Zhu, Wei Liu, Xuebin Hu, Qian Sun, Jia-Ling Fu, Xiangcheng Tang, Yizhi Liu, David Wan-Cheng Li, Lili Gong, ",Cell death and differentiation,NO_DATE,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35347235
193,"MAP-SNN: Mapping spike activities with multiplicity, adaptability, and plasticity into bio-plausible spiking neural networks","Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are considered more biologically realistic and power-efficient as they imitate the fundamental mechanism of the human brain. Backpropagation (BP) based SNN learning algorithms that utilize deep learning frameworks have achieved good performance. However, those BP-based algorithms partially ignore bio-interpretability. In modeling spike activity for biological plausible BP-based SNNs, we examine three properties: multiplicity, adaptability, and plasticity (MAP). Regarding multiplicity, we propose a Multiple-Spike Pattern (MSP) with multiple-spike transmission to improve model robustness in discrete time iterations. To realize adaptability, we adopt Spike Frequency Adaption (SFA) under MSP to reduce spike activities for enhanced efficiency. For plasticity, we propose a trainable state-free synapse that models spike response current to increase the diversity of spiking neurons for temporal feature extraction. The proposed SNN model achieves competitive performances on the N-MNIST and SHD neuromorphic datasets. In addition, experimental results demonstrate that the proposed three aspects are significant to iterative robustness, spike efficiency, and the capacity to extract spikes' temporal features. In summary, this study presents a realistic approach for bio-inspired spike activity with MAP, presenting a novel neuromorphic perspective for incorporating biological properties into spiking neural networks.","['1 College of Information Science and Electronic Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', '2 Zhejiang University - University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Institute, Zhejiang University, Haining, China.', '3 College of Computer Science and Technology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.']","Chengting Yu, Yangkai Du, Mufeng Chen, Aili Wang, Gaoang Wang, Erping Li, ",Frontiers in neuroscience,2022,backpropagation (BP); leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neuron; multiple spike pattern (MSP); neuromorphic recognition; spike frequency adaption (SFA); spiking neural network (SNN); state-free synaptic response model (SFSRM).,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36203801
194,Toward Robust Cognitive 3D Brain-Inspired Cross-Paradigm System,"Spiking Neuromorphic systems have been introduced as promising platforms for energy-efficient spiking neural network (SNNs) execution. SNNs incorporate neuronal and synaptic states in addition to the variant time scale into their computational model. Since each neuron in these networks is connected to many others, high bandwidth is required. Moreover, since the spike times are used to encode information in SNN, a precise communication latency is also needed, although SNN is tolerant to the spike delay variation in some limits when it is seen as a whole. The two-dimensional packet-switched network-on-chip was proposed as a solution to provide a scalable interconnect fabric in large-scale spike-based neural networks. The 3D-ICs have also attracted a lot of attention as a potential solution to resolve the interconnect bottleneck. Combining these two emerging technologies provides a new horizon for IC design to satisfy the high requirements of low power and small footprint in emerging AI applications. Moreover, although fault-tolerance is a natural feature of biological systems, integrating many computation and memory units into neuromorphic chips confronts the reliability issue, where a defective part can affect the overall system's performance. This paper presents the design and simulation of R-NASH-a reliable three-dimensional digital neuromorphic system geared explicitly toward the 3D-ICs biological brain's three-dimensional structure, where information in the network is represented by sparse patterns of spike timing and learning is based on the local spike-timing-dependent-plasticity rule. Our platform enables high integration density and small spike delay of spiking networks and features a scalable design.

195,Scene Recognition Using Deep Softpool Capsule Network Based on Residual Diverse Branch Block,"With the improvement of the quality and resolution of remote sensing (RS) images, scene recognition tasks have played an important role in the RS community. However, due to the special bird's eye view image acquisition mode of imaging sensors, it is still challenging to construct a discriminate representation of diverse and complex scenes to improve RS image recognition performance. Capsule networks that can learn the spatial relationship between the features in an image has a good image classification performance. However, the original capsule network is not suitable for images with a complex background. To address the above issues, this paper proposes a novel end-to-end capsule network termed DS-CapsNet, in which a new multi-scale feature enhancement module and a new Caps-SoftPool method are advanced by aggregating the advantageous attributes of the residual convolution architecture, Diverse Branch Block (DBB), Squeeze and Excitation (SE) block, and the Caps-SoftPool method. By using the residual DBB, multiscale features can be extracted and fused to recover a semantic strong feature representation. By adopting SE, the informative features are emphasized, and the less salient features are weakened. The new Caps-SoftPool method can reduce the number of parameters that are needed in order to prevent an over-fitting problem. The novel DS-CapsNet achieves a competitive and promising performance for RS image recognition by using high-quality and robust capsule representation. The extensive experiments on two challenging datasets, AID and NWPU-RESISC45, demonstrate the robustness and superiority of the proposed DS-CapsNet in scene recognition tasks.","['1 School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Shanghai University of Engineering Science, Shanghai 201620, China.', '2 Shanghai Institute of Satellite Engineering, Shanghai 200240, China.']","Chunyuan Wang, Yang Wu, Yihan Wang, Yiping Chen, ","Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2021,capsule network; diverse branch block; residual convolution; scene recognition; squeeze and excitation.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34451017
196,Design of Optimal Deep Learning-Based Pancreatic Tumor and Nontumor Classification Model Using Computed Tomography Scans,"Pancreatic tumor is a lethal kind of tumor and its prediction is really poor in the current scenario. Automated pancreatic tumor classification using computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) model is necessary to track, predict, and classify the existence of pancreatic tumors. Artificial intelligence (AI) can offer extensive diagnostic expertise and accurate interventional image interpretation. With this motivation, this study designs an optimal deep learning based pancreatic tumor and nontumor classification (ODL-PTNTC) model using CT images. The goal of the ODL-PTNTC technique is to detect and classify the existence of pancreatic tumors and nontumor. The proposed ODL-PTNTC technique includes adaptive window filtering (AWF) technique to remove noise existing in it. In addition, sailfish optimizer based Kapur's Thresholding (SFO-KT) technique is employed for image segmentation process. Moreover, feature extraction using Capsule Network (CapsNet) is derived to generate a set of feature vectors. Furthermore, Political Optimizer (PO) with Cascade Forward Neural Network (CFNN) is employed for classification purposes. In order to validate the enhanced performance of the ODL-PTNTC technique, a series of simulations take place and the results are investigated under several aspects. A comprehensive comparative results analysis stated the promising performance of the ODL-PTNTC technique over the recent approaches.","['1 Department of Computer Science College of Computing and Information Technology, Taif University, P.O.

197,Melanoma Recognition by Fusing Convolutional Blocks and Dynamic Routing between Capsules,"Skin cancer is one of the most common types of cancers in the world, with melanoma being the most lethal form. Automatic melanoma diagnosis from skin images has recently gained attention within the machine learning community, due to the complexity involved. In the past few years, convolutional neural network models have been commonly used to approach this issue. This type of model, however, presents disadvantages that sometimes hamper its application in real-world situations, e.g., the construction of transformation-invariant models and their inability to consider spatial hierarchies between entities within an image. Recently, Dynamic Routing between Capsules architecture (CapsNet) has been proposed to overcome such limitations. This work is aimed at proposing a new architecture which combines convolutional blocks with a customized CapsNet architecture, allowing for the extraction of richer abstract features. This architecture uses high-quality 299×299×3 skin lesion images, and a hyper-tuning of the main parameters is performed in order to ensure effective learning under limited training data. An extensive experimental study on eleven image datasets was conducted where the proposal significantly outperformed several state-of-the-art models. Finally, predictions made by the model were validated through the application of two modern model-agnostic interpretation tools.","['1 Knowledge Discovery and Intelligent Systems in Biomedicine Laboratory Maimónides Biomedical Research Institute of Córdoba, 14004 Córdoba, Spain.', '2 Department of Computer Science and Numerical Analysis, University of Córdoba, 14071 Córdoba, Spain.', '3 Department of Information Systems, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah 21413, Saudi Arabia.']","Eduardo Pérez, Sebastián Ventura, ",Cancers,2021,CapsNet; convolutional neural network; interpretation tool; melanoma diagnosis.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34638456
198,Immunohistochemical features of cells in peripheral microcystoid retinal degeneration,"Peripheral microcystoid retinal degeneration (PMD) is an age-related, benign condition in which the peripheral retina develops small holes and undergoes cystic degeneration. This paper demonstrates neuronal alterations in PMD, as studied by immunohistochemistry in postmortem donor eyes (age: 76-89 years; N = 6 donors). In all cases, the degeneration was located in the inferior temporal quadrant, creating holes in the far peripheral retina. There was thinning of the inner retinal layers and the outer plexiform layer (OPL) was patchy or inconspicuous. As a response, Müller cell processes showed increased vimentin immunoreactivity. None of the retinas examined expressed glial fibrillary acidic protein. Cone photoreceptor cells were significantly altered: compared to the adjoining cones that were short, those located in the cystoid retina underwent significant elongation of their inner segments, evident from calbindin immunolabeling, to maintain synaptic contacts with the remnant OPL. The latter consisted of small photoreceptor terminals and scanty processes from shrunken bipolar cells. Besides, cones and ganglion cells undergo oxidative stress, they showed immunoreactivity to 4-hydroxy 2-nonenal and nitrotyrosine. The level of superoxide dismutase-2 was relatively low in the PMD region than in adjacent area, suggesting that the former suffers from oxidative stress.","['1 Department of Anatomy, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.

199,Visual properties of human retinal ganglion cells,"The retinal output is the sole source of visual information for the brain. Studies in non-primate mammals estimate that this information is carried by several dozens of retinal ganglion cell types, each informing the brain about different aspects of a visual scene. Even though morphological studies of primate retina suggest a similar diversity of ganglion cell types, research has focused on the function of only a few cell types. In human retina, recordings from individual cells are anecdotal or focus on a small subset of identified types. Here, we present the first systematic ex-vivo recording of light responses from 342 ganglion cells in human retinas obtained from donors. We find a great variety in the human retinal output in terms of preferences for positive or negative contrast, spatio-temporal frequency encoding, contrast sensitivity, and speed tuning. Some human ganglion cells showed similar response behavior as known cell types in other primate retinas, while we also recorded light responses that have not been described previously. This first extensive description of the human retinal output should facilitate interpretation of primate data and comparison to other mammalian species, and it lays the basis for the use of ex-vivo human retina for in-vitro analysis of novel treatment approaches.","['1 Retinal Circuits and Optogenetics, Centre for Integrative Neuroscience and Bernstein Center for Computational Neuroscience, University of Tübingen, Tübingen, Germany.', '2 Neuroscience Graduate School, University of Tübingen, Tübingen, Germany.', '3 Institute for Ophthalmic Research, University of Tübingen, Tübingen, Germany.']","Katja Reinhard, Thomas A Münch, ",PloS one,2021,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33592045

Several memory models have been proposed up to now in order to unveil how the memory is organized in the brain. In this paper, we adopt spatio-temporal memory (STM) model, in which both associative memory and episodic memory are analyzed and emulated, as the reference of our hardware network architecture. Furthermore, some reasonable adaptations are carried out for the hardware implementation. We finally implement this memory model on FPGA, and additional experiments are performed to fine tune the parameters of our network deployed on FPGA.","['1 Institute of Microelectronics, Peking University, Beijing, China.', '2 National Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Micro/Nano Fabrication, Peking University, Beijing, China.', '3 College of Computer Science, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.']","Kefei Liu, Xiaoxin Cui, Yi Zhong, Yisong Kuang, Yuan Wang, Huajin Tang, Ru Huang, ",Frontiers in neuroscience,2019,FPGA; brain-inspired; memory model; neuromorphic hardware; spatio-temporal memory; spike neural network.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31447641
201,Hybrid 2D/CMOS microchips for memristive applications,"Exploiting the excellent electronic properties of two-dimensional (2D) materials to fabricate advanced electronic circuits is a major goal for the semiconductors industry1-2. However, most studies in this field have been limited to the fabrication and characterization of isolated large (>1µm2) devices on unfunctional SiO2/Si substrates. Some studies integrated monolayer graphene on silicon microchips as large-area (>500µm2) interconnection3 and as channel of large transistors (~16.5µm2)4-5, but in all cases the integration density was low, no computation was demonstrated, and manipulating monolayer 2D materials was challenging because native pinholes and cracks during transfer increase variability and reduce yield. Here we present the fabrication of high-integration-density 2D/CMOS hybrid microchips for memristive applications - CMOS stands for complementary metal oxide semiconductor. We transfer a sheet of multilayer hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) onto the back-end-of-line (BEOL) interconnections of silicon microchips containing CMOS transistors of the 180nm node, and finalize the circuits by patterning the top electrodes and interconnections. The CMOS transistors provide outstanding control over the currents across the h-BN memristors, which allows us to achieve endurances of ~5 million cycles in memristors as small as ~0.053µm2. We demonstrate in-memory computation by constructing logic gates, and measure spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) signals that are suitable for the implementation of spiking neural networks (SNN). The high performance and the relatively-high technology readiness level achieved represent a significant advance towards the integration of 2D materials in microelectronic products and memristive applications.","['1 Materials Science and Engineering Program, Physical Science and Engineering Division, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Thuwal, Saudi Arabia.', '2 Institute of Microelectronics, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China.', '3 Dipartimento di Elettronica, Informazione e Bioingegneria, Politecnico di Milano, Piazza L. da Vinci 32, Milano, Italy.', '4 Department of Thermal and Fluid Engineering, Faculty of Engineering Technology, University of Twente, Enschede, Netherlands.', '5 Instituto de Micro y Nanotecnología, IMN-CNM, CSIC (CEI UAM+CSIC), Madrid, Spain.', '6 Institute of Functional Nano & Soft Materials, Collaborative Innovation Center of Suzhou Nanoscience and Technology, Soochow University, 199 Ren-Ai Road, Suzhou, China.', '7 Computer, Electrical and Mathematical Sciences and Engineering Division, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, Thuwal, Saudi Arabia.', '8 Departamento de Electrónica y Tecnología de Computadores, Facultad de Ciencias, Universidad de Granada, Avenida Fuentenueva s/n, Granada, Spain.', '9 Department of Electrical Engineering and Media Technology, Deggendorf Institute of Technology, Dieter-Görlitz-Platz 1, Deggendorf, Germany.', '10 Institute for Microelectronics, TU Wien, Gusshausstrasse 27-29, Vienna, Austria.', '11 Materials Science and Engineering Program, Physical Science and Engineering Division, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Thuwal, Saudi Arabia. mario.lanza@kaust.edu.sa.']","Kaichen Zhu, Sebastian Pazos, Fernando Aguirre, Yaqing Shen, Yue Yuan, Wenwen Zheng, Osamah Alharbi, Marco A Villena, Bin Fang, Xinyi Li, Alessandro Milozzi, Matteo Farronato, Miguel Muñoz-Rojo, Tao Wang, Ren Li, Hossein Fariborzi, Juan B Roldan, Guenther Benstetter, Xixiang Zhang, Husam Alshareef, Tibor Grasser, Huaqiang Wu, Daniele Ielmini, Mario Lanza, ",Nature,2023,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36972685
202,Efficient multi-scale representation of visual objects using a biologically plausible spike-latency code and winner-take-all inhibition,"Deep neural networks have surpassed human performance in key visual challenges such as object recognition, but require a large amount of energy, computation, and memory. In contrast, spiking neural networks (SNNs) have the potential to improve both the efficiency and biological plausibility of object recognition systems. Here we present a SNN model that uses spike-latency coding and winner-take-all inhibition (WTA-I) to efficiently represent visual stimuli using multi-scale parallel processing. Mimicking neuronal response properties in early visual cortex, images were preprocessed with three different spatial frequency (SF) channels, before they were fed to a layer of spiking neurons whose synaptic weights were updated using spike-timing-dependent-plasticity. We investigate how the quality of the represented objects changes under different SF bands and WTA-I schemes. We demonstrate that a network of 200 spiking neurons tuned to three SFs can efficiently represent objects with as little as 15 spikes per neuron. Studying how core object recognition may be implemented using biologically plausible learning rules in SNNs may not only further our understanding of the brain, but also lead to novel and efficient artificial vision systems.","['1 Department of Computer Science, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA, USA. mesangar@ucsb.edu.', '2 The Picower Institute for Learning and Memory, Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Boston, MA, USA.', '3 CerCo CNRS UMR5549, Université de Toulouse III-Paul Sabatier, Toulouse, France.', '4 IPAL, CNRS IRL 2955, Singapore, Singapore.', '5 Department of Computer Science, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA, USA.', '6 Department of Psychological & Brain Sciences, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA, USA.']","Melani Sanchez-Garcia, Tushar Chauhan, Benoit R Cottereau, Michael Beyeler, ",Biological cybernetics,NO_DATE,Multi-scale processing; Spike-latency code; Spike-timing-dependent-plasticity; Spiking neural networks; Winner-take-all inhibition.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37004546

We used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to generate a cell atlas of the chick retina. We identified 136 cell types plus 14 positional or developmental intermediates distributed among the six classes conserved across vertebrates - photoreceptor, horizontal, bipolar, amacrine, retinal ganglion, and glial cells. To assess morphology of molecularly defined types, we adapted a method for CRISPR-based integration of reporters into selectively expressed genes. For Müller glia, we found that transcriptionally distinct cells were regionally localized along the anterior-posterior, dorsal-ventral, and central-peripheral retinal axes. We also identified immature photoreceptor, horizontal cell, and oligodendrocyte types that persist into late embryonic stages. Finally, we analyzed relationships among chick, mouse, and primate retinal cell classes and types. Our results provide a foundation for anatomical, physiological, evolutionary, and developmental studies of the avian visual system.","['1 Center for Brain Science and Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Harvard University, Cambridge, United States.']","Masahito Yamagata, Wenjun Yan, Joshua R Sanes, ",eLife,2021,cell atlas; chicken; evolution; neuroscience; photoreceptor; retina; retinal ganglion cell; scRNAseq.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33393903
204,SpikePropamine: Differentiable Plasticity in Spiking Neural Networks,"The adaptive changes in synaptic efficacy that occur between spiking neurons have been demonstrated to play a critical role in learning for biological neural networks. Despite this source of inspiration, many learning focused applications using Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) retain static synaptic connections, preventing additional learning after the initial training period. Here, we introduce a framework for simultaneously learning the underlying fixed-weights and the rules governing the dynamics of synaptic plasticity and neuromodulated synaptic plasticity in SNNs through gradient descent. We further demonstrate the capabilities of this framework on a series of challenging benchmarks, learning the parameters of several plasticity rules including BCM, Oja's, and their respective set of neuromodulatory variants. The experimental results display that SNNs augmented with differentiable plasticity are sufficient for solving a set of challenging temporal learning tasks that a traditional SNN fails to solve, even in the presence of significant noise. These networks are also shown to be capable of producing locomotion on a high-dimensional robotic learning task, where near-minimal degradation in performance is observed in the presence of novel conditions not seen during the initial training period.","['1 U.S. Naval Research Laboratory, Washington, DC, United States.']","Samuel Schmidgall, Julia Ashkanazy, Wallace Lawson, Joe Hays, ",Frontiers in neurorobotics,2021,backpropagation; motor learning; neuromodulation; plasticity; reinforcement learning; robotic learning; spiking neural network; temporal learning.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34630063
205,Cholesterol Regulation in Age-Related Macular Degeneration: A Framework for Mathematical Modelling of Drusen Biogenesis,"In age-related macular degeneration (AMD), there is, in common with many other age-related diseases, the need to distinguish between changes in the ageing eye that lead to disease and those changes that are considered part of a healthy, ageing eye. Various studies investigating the multitude of mechanisms involved in the aetiology of AMD exist within the field of ophthalmology and related medical fields, yet many aspects of it remain poorly understood and only a limited number of therapies are available. A recent study relates drusen's topographically cellular characteristics to the neural retina's metabolic needs and associated cholesterol involvement within the retina. In particular, there is a need to fully understand the maintenance of cholesterol homeostasis in the retina to prevent normal ageing processes from being perturbed towards maculopathy. Here, we present an extensive review of the clinical and physiological features of the ageing retina, as well as mechanisms implicated in pathology, synthesised from a vast body of the published literature. We use this novel synthesis to construct a comprehensive process schematic, encompassing all key species and physiological processes such as nutrients, waste and lipoprotein management. We are therefore able to express these processes in a mathematical language via a comprehensive modelling framework, comprising a set of twenty-three equations spanning three distinct biological compartments. This very general modelling framework may now be adapted to more focused studies on individual mechanisms, processes or components underlying of the many facets of AMD. As an example of such a focused application, we conclude this article with a one-compartment, four-species model of the retinal pigment epithelium, which considers the parametric conditions under which either cholesterol homeostasis or unregulated accumulation of cholesterol may obtain in the ageing eye.","['1 School of Mathematical Sciences, Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, Qld, 4000, Australia.', '2 Institute of Health and Biomedical Innovation (IHBI), 60 Musk Avenue, Kelvin Grove, Qld, 4059, Australia.', '3 School of Mathematical Sciences, Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, Qld, 4000, Australia. r.araujo@qut.edu.au.', '4 Institute of Health and Biomedical Innovation (IHBI), 60 Musk Avenue, Kelvin Grove, Qld, 4059, Australia. r.araujo@qut.edu.au.']","Ronél Scheepers, Graeme J Pettet, Peter van Heijster, Robyn P Araujo, ",Bulletin of mathematical biology,2020,AMD; Cholesterol; Drusen; Homeostasis; Macula; Mathematical modelling.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33044644

In this work, we propose a compact digital design for the implementation of high-volume SNN that considers the intrinsic stochastic processes present in biological neurons and enables high-density hardware implementation. The proposed stochastic SNN model (SSNN) is compared with previous SSNN models, achieving a higher processing speed. We also show how the proposed model can be scaled to high-volume neural networks trained by using back propagation and applied to a pattern classification task. The proposed model achieves better results compared with other recently-published SNN models configured with unsupervised STDP learning.","['1 Electronics Engineering Group, Physics Department, Universitat de les Illes Balears, Mateu Orfila Building, Ctra.

A departure from conventional computing systems to make use of the high parallelism of Bayesian inference has attracted recent attention, particularly in the hardware implementation of Bayesian networks. These efforts lead to several implementations ranging from digital circuits, mixed-signal circuits, to analog circuits by leveraging new emerging nonvolatile devices.

Within H-SNN, hierarchical spatial and temporal patterns are constructed with convolution connections and memory pathways containing spiking neurons with different dynamics. We demonstrate analytically the formation of long and short term memory in H-SNN and distinct response functions of memory pathways. In simulation, the network is tested on visual input of moving objects to simultaneously predict for object class and motion dynamics. Results show that H-SNN achieves prediction accuracy on similar or higher level than supervised deep neural networks (DNN). Compared to SNN trained with back-propagation, H-SNN effectively utilizes STDP to learn spatiotemporal patterns that have better generalizability to unknown motion and/or object classes encountered during inference. In addition, the improved performance is achieved with 6x fewer parameters than complex DNNs, showing H-SNN as an efficient approach for applications with constrained computation resources.","['1 Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, United States.']","Xueyuan She, Saurabh Dash, Daehyun Kim, Saibal Mukhopadhyay, ",Frontiers in neuroscience,2021,multi-objective prediction; neuromorphic computing; spatiotemporal data processing; spiking neural network; unsupervised STDP learning.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33519366
211,MultiCapsNet: A General Framework for Data Integration and Interpretable Classification,"The latest progresses of experimental biology have generated a large number of data with different formats and lengths. Deep learning is an ideal tool to deal with complex datasets, but its inherent ""black box"" nature needs more interpretability. At the same time, traditional interpretable machine learning methods, such as linear regression or random forest, could only deal with numerical features instead of modular features often encountered in the biological field. Here, we present MultiCapsNet (https://github.com/wanglf19/MultiCapsNet), a new deep learning model built on CapsNet and scCapsNet, which possesses the merits such as easy data integration and high model interpretability. To demonstrate the ability of this model as an interpretable classifier to deal with modular inputs, we test MultiCapsNet on three datasets with different data type and application scenarios. Firstly, on the labeled variant call dataset, MultiCapsNet shows a similar classification performance with neural network model, and provides importance scores for data sources directly without an extra importance determination step required by the neural network model. The importance scores generated by these two models are highly correlated. Secondly, on single cell RNA sequence (scRNA-seq) dataset, MultiCapsNet integrates information about protein-protein interaction (PPI), and protein-DNA interaction (PDI). The classification accuracy of MultiCapsNet is comparable to the neural network and random forest model. Meanwhile, MultiCapsNet reveals how each transcription factor (TF) or PPI cluster node contributes to classification of cell type. Thirdly, we made a comparison between MultiCapsNet and SCENIC. The results show several cell type relevant TFs identified by both methods, further proving the validity and interpretability of the MultiCapsNet.","['1 Shulan (Hangzhou) Hospital Affiliated to Zhejiang Shuren University Shulan International Medical College, Hangzhou, China.', '2 China National Center for Bioinformation, Beijing, China.', '3 Key Laboratory of Genomic and Precision Medicine, Beijing Institute of Genomics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.', '4 University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.', '5 School of Systems Science, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, China.']","Lifei Wang, Xuexia Miao, Rui Nie, Zhang Zhang, Jiang Zhang, Jun Cai, ",Frontiers in genetics,2021,capsule network; classification; data integration; interpretability; modular feature.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34899854
212,Retinal Plasticity,"Brain plasticity is a well-established concept designating the ability of central nervous system (CNS) neurons to rearrange as a result of learning, when adapting to changeable environmental conditions or else while reacting to injurious factors. As a part of the CNS, the retina has been repeatedly probed for its possible ability to respond plastically to a variably altered environment or to pathological insults. However, numerous studies support the conclusion that the retina, outside the developmental stage, is endowed with only limited plasticity, exhibiting, instead, a remarkable ability to maintain a stable architectural and functional organization.

213,A review of learning in biologically plausible spiking neural networks,"Artificial neural networks have been used as a powerful processing tool in various areas such as pattern recognition, control, robotics, and bioinformatics. Their wide applicability has encouraged researchers to improve artificial neural networks by investigating the biological brain. Neurological research has significantly progressed in recent years and continues to reveal new characteristics of biological neurons. New technologies can now capture temporal changes in the internal activity of the brain in more detail and help clarify the relationship between brain activity and the perception of a given stimulus. This new knowledge has led to a new type of artificial neural network, the Spiking Neural Network (SNN), that draws more faithfully on biological properties to provide higher processing abilities. A review of recent developments in learning of spiking neurons is presented in this paper. First the biological background of SNN learning algorithms is reviewed. The important elements of a learning algorithm such as the neuron model, synaptic plasticity, information encoding and SNN topologies are then presented. Then, a critical review of the state-of-the-art learning algorithms for SNNs using single and multiple spikes is presented. Additionally, deep spiking neural networks are reviewed, and challenges and opportunities in the SNN field are discussed.","['1 School of Computer Science and Informatics, Faculty of Computing, Engineering and Media, De Montfort University, Leicester, UK.

214,Spiking Neural Networks for Structural Health Monitoring,"This paper presents the first implementation of a spiking neural network (SNN) for the extraction of cepstral coefficients in structural health monitoring (SHM) applications and demonstrates the possibilities of neuromorphic computing in this field. In this regard, we show that spiking neural networks can be effectively used to extract cepstral coefficients as features of vibration signals of structures in their operational conditions. We demonstrate that the neural cepstral coefficients extracted by the network can be successfully used for anomaly detection. To address the power efficiency of sensor nodes, related to both processing and transmission, affecting the applicability of the proposed approach, we implement the algorithm on specialised neuromorphic hardware (Intel ® Loihi architecture) and benchmark the results using numerical and experimental data of degradation in the form of stiffness change of a single degree of freedom system excited by Gaussian white noise. The work is expected to open a new direction of SHM applications towards non-Von Neumann computing through a neuromorphic approach.","['1 UCD Centre for Mechanics, Dynamical Systems and Risk Laboratory, School of Mechanical and Materials Engineering, University College Dublin, 4 Dublin, Ireland.']","George Vathakkattil Joseph, Vikram Pakrashi, ","Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2022,Loihi; Mahalanobis distance; cepstrum; low-power; neuromorphic; spiking neural network.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36501946
215,Toward Reflective Spiking Neural Networks Exploiting Memristive Devices,"The design of modern convolutional artificial neural networks (ANNs) composed of formal neurons copies the architecture of the visual cortex. Signals proceed through a hierarchy, where receptive fields become increasingly more complex and coding sparse. Nowadays, ANNs outperform humans in controlled pattern recognition tasks yet remain far behind in cognition. In part, it happens due to limited knowledge about the higher echelons of the brain hierarchy, where neurons actively generate predictions about what will happen next, i.e., the information processing jumps from reflex to reflection. In this study, we forecast that spiking neural networks (SNNs) can achieve the next qualitative leap. Reflective SNNs may take advantage of their intrinsic dynamics and mimic complex, not reflex-based, brain actions. They also enable a significant reduction in energy consumption. However, the training of SNNs is a challenging problem, strongly limiting their deployment. We then briefly overview new insights provided by the concept of a high-dimensional brain, which has been put forward to explain the potential power of single neurons in higher brain stations and deep SNN layers. Finally, we discuss the prospect of implementing neural networks in memristive systems. Such systems can densely pack on a chip 2D or 3D arrays of plastic synaptic contacts directly processing analog information. Thus, memristive devices are a good candidate for implementing in-memory and in-sensor computing. Then, memristive SNNs can diverge from the development of ANNs and build their niche, cognitive, or reflective computations.","['1 Instituto de Matemática Interdisciplinar, Universidad Complutense de Madrid, Madrid, Spain.', '2 Department of Neurotechnologies, Research Institute of Physics and Technology, Laboratory of Stochastic Multistable Systems, Lobachevsky State University of Nizhny Novgorod, Nizhny Novgorod, Russia.', '3 Neuroscience and Cognitive Technology Laboratory, Center for Technologies in Robotics and Mechatronics Components, Innopolis University, Innopolis, Russia.', '4 Center For Neurotechnology and Machine Learning, Immanuel Kant Baltic Federal University, Kaliningrad, Russia.', '5 Department of Information Technologies, Vladimir State University, Vladimir, Russia.']","Valeri A Makarov, Sergey A Lobov, Sergey Shchanikov, Alexey Mikhaylov, Viktor B Kazantsev, ",Frontiers in computational neuroscience,2022,high-dimensional brain; memristors and memristive systems; plasticity; reflective systems; spiking neural networks (SNNs).,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35782090

Among novel approaches to overcome this limitation and to bring to therapy more potent and selective agents is the use of light for selective activation of anticancer compounds. In this review, we focus on the anticancer applications of two light-activated approaches still in the experimental phase: photoremovable protecting groups (""photocages"") and photoswitches. We describe the structural considerations behind the development of novel compounds and the plethora of assays used to confirm whether the photochemical and pharmacological properties are meeting the stringent criteria for an efficient in vivo light-dependent activation. Despite its immense potential, light activation brings many challenges, and the complexity of the task is very demanding. Currently, we are still deeply in the phase of pharmacological tools, but the vivid research and rapid development bring the light of hope for potential clinical use.","['1 Department of Organic Chemistry, Semmelweis University, 1092 Budapest, Hungary.', '2 Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Ljubljana, 1000 Ljubljana, Slovenia.']","Petra Dunkel, Janez Ilaš, ",Cancers,2021,azobenzenes; light-activatable materials; photocages; photopharmacology; photoresponsive drug delivery systems; photoswitches.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34209493
217,Genetic code expansion via integration of redundant amino acid assignment by finely tuning tRNA pools,"In all translation systems, the genetic code assigns codons to amino acids as building blocks of polypeptides, defining their chemical, structural and physiological properties. The canonical genetic code, however, utilizes only 20 proteinogenic amino acids redundantly encoded in 61 codons. In order to expand the building block repertoire, this redundancy was reduced by tuning composition of the transfer RNA (tRNA) mixture in vitro. Depletion of particular tRNAs from the total tRNA mixture or its reconstitution with in vitro-transcribed tRNASNNs (S = C or G, N = U, C, A or G) divided a codon box to encode two amino acids, expanding the repertoire to 23. The expanded genetic codes may benefit analysis of cellular regulatory pathways and drug screening.","['1 Department of Chemistry, Graduate School of Science, The University of Tokyo, 7-3-1, Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-0033, Japan.', '2 Department of Chemistry, Graduate School of Science, The University of Tokyo, 7-3-1, Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-0033, Japan.

218,Artificial Olfactory Neuron for an In-Sensor Neuromorphic Nose,"A neuromorphic module of an electronic nose (E-nose) is demonstrated by hybridizing a chemoresistive gas sensor made of a semiconductor metal oxide (SMO) and a single transistor neuron (1T-neuron) made of a metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET). By mimicking a biological olfactory neuron, it simultaneously detects a gas and encoded spike signals for in-sensor neuromorphic functioning. It identifies an odor source by analyzing the complicated mixed signals using a spiking neural network (SNN). The proposed E-nose does not require conversion circuits, which are essential for processing the sensory signals between the sensor array and processors in the conventional bulky E-nose. In addition, they do not have to include a central processing unit (CPU) and memory, which are required for von Neumann computing. The spike transmission of the biological olfactory system, which is known to be the main factor for reducing power consumption, is realized with the SNN for power savings compared to the conventional E-nose with a deep neural network (DNN). Therefore, the proposed neuromorphic E-nose is promising for application to Internet of Things (IoT), which demands a highly scalable and energy-efficient system. As a practical example, it is employed as an electronic sommelier by classifying different types of wines.","['1 School of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), 291 Daehak-ro, Yuseong-gu, Daejeon, 34141, Republic of Korea.', '2 Department of Mechanical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), 291 Daehak-ro, Yuseong-gu, Daejeon, 34141, Republic of Korea.']","Joon-Kyu Han, Mingu Kang, Jaeseok Jeong, Incheol Cho, Ji-Man Yu, Kuk-Jin Yoon, Inkyu Park, Yang-Kyu Choi, ","Advanced science (Weinheim, Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany)",NO_DATE,electronic nose (E-nose); electronic sommelier; neuromorphic system; olfactory neuron; spiking neural network (SNN).,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35426489
219,Efficient Spiking Neural Networks With Radix Encoding,"Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have advantages in latency and energy efficiency over traditional artificial neural networks (ANNs) due to their event-driven computation mechanism and the replacement of energy-consuming weight multiplication with addition. However, to achieve high accuracy, it usually requires long spike trains to ensure accuracy, usually more than 1000 time steps. This offsets the computation efficiency brought by SNNs because a longer spike train means a larger number of operations and larger latency. In this article, we propose a radix-encoded SNN, which has ultrashort spike trains. Specifically, it is able to use less than six time steps to achieve even higher accuracy than its traditional counterpart. We also develop a method to fit our radix encoding technique into the ANN-to-SNN conversion approach so that we can train radix-encoded SNNs more efficiently on mature platforms and hardware. Experiments show that our radix encoding can achieve 25 × improvement in latency and 1.7% improvement in accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art method using the VGG-16 network on the CIFAR-10 dataset.",NO_AFFILIATIONS,"Zhehui Wang, Xiaozhe Gu, Rick Siow Mong Goh, Joey Tianyi Zhou, Tao Luo, ",IEEE transactions on neural networks and learning systems,2022,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35969543
220,A computational framework to investigate retinal haemodynamics and tissue stress,"The process of vision begins in the retina, yet the role of biomechanical forces in the retina is relatively unknown and only recently being explored. This contribution describes a computational framework involving 3D fluid-structure interaction simulations derived from fundus images that work towards creating unique data on retinal biomechanics. We developed methods to convert 2D fundus photographs into 3D geometries that follow the curvature of the retina. Retina arterioles are embedded into a six-layer representation of the retinal tissue with varying material properties throughout the retinal tissue. Using three different human retinas (healthy, glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy) and by varying our simulation approaches, we report the effects of transient versus steady flow, viscosity assumptions (Newtonian, non-Newtonian and Fåhræus-Lindqvist effect) and rigid versus compliant retinal tissue, on resulting wall shear stress (WSS) and von Mises stress. In the retinal arterioles, the choice of viscosity model is important and WSS obtained from models with the Fåhræus-Lindqvist effect is markedly different from Newtonian and non-Newtonian models. We found little difference in WSS between steady-state and pulsatile simulations (< 5%) and show that WSS varies by about 7% between rigid and deformable models. Comparing the three geometries, we found notably different WSS in the healthy (3.3 ± 1.3 Pa), glaucoma (5.7 ± 1.6 Pa) and diabetic retinopathy cases (4.3 ± 1.1 Pa). Conversely, von Mises stress was similar in each case. We have reported a novel biomechanical framework to explore the stresses in the retina. Despite current limitations and lack of complete subject-specific physiological inputs, we believe our framework is the first of its kind and with further improvements could be useful to better understand the biomechanics of the retina.","['1 Vascular Engineering Laboratory, Harry Perkins Institute of Medical Research, QEII Medical Centre, Nedlands and Centre for Medical Research, The University of Western Australia, 6 Verdun Street, Nedlands, Perth, WA, 6009, Australia.', '2 School of Engineering, The University of Western Australia, Perth, Australia.', '3 Centre for Ophthalmology and Visual Science, The University of Western Australia, Perth, Australia.', '4 Lions Eye Institute, Perth, Australia.', '5 Department of Ophthalmology, Royal Perth Hospital, Perth, Australia.', '6 Vascular Engineering Laboratory, Harry Perkins Institute of Medical Research, QEII Medical Centre, Nedlands and Centre for Medical Research, The University of Western Australia, 6 Verdun Street, Nedlands, Perth, WA, 6009, Australia. barry.doyle@uwa.edu.au.', '7 School of Engineering, The University of Western Australia, Perth, Australia. barry.doyle@uwa.edu.au.', '8 Australian Research Council Centre for Personalised Therapeutics Technologies, Perth, Australia. barry.doyle@uwa.edu.au.', '9 British Heart Foundation Centre for Cardiovascular Science, The University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK. barry.doyle@uwa.edu.au.']","Joseph Rebhan, Louis P Parker, Lachlan J Kelsey, Fred K Chen, Barry J Doyle, ",Biomechanics and modeling in mechanobiology,NO_DATE,Biomechanics; Haemodynamics; Retina.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31140054
221,Rethinking Pretraining as a Bridge From ANNs to SNNs,"Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are known as typical kinds of brain-inspired models with their unique features of rich neuronal dynamics, diverse coding schemes, and low power consumption properties. How to obtain a high-accuracy model has always been the main challenge in the field of SNN. Currently, there are two mainstream methods, i.e., obtaining a converted SNN through converting a well-trained artificial NN (ANN) to its SNN counterpart or training an SNN directly. However, the inference time of a converted SNN is too long, while SNN training is generally very costly and inefficient. In this work, a new SNN training paradigm is proposed by combining the concepts of the two different training methods with the help of the pretrain technique and BP-based deep SNN training mechanism. We believe that the proposed paradigm is a more efficient pipeline for training SNNs. The pipeline includes pipe-S for static data transfer tasks and pipe-D for dynamic data transfer tasks. State-of-the-art (SOTA) results are obtained in a large-scale event-driven dataset ES-ImageNet. For training acceleration, we achieve the same (or higher) best accuracy as similar leaky-integrate-and-fire (LIF)-SNNs using 1/8 training time on ImageNet-1K and 1/2 training time on ES-ImageNet and also provide a time-accuracy benchmark for a new dataset ES-UCF101.

222,Spike-Based Approximate Backpropagation Algorithm of Brain-Inspired Deep SNN for Sonar Target Classification,"With the development of neuromorphic computing, more and more attention has been paid to a brain-inspired spiking neural network (SNN) because of its ultralow energy consumption and high-performance spatiotemporal information processing. Due to the discontinuity of the spiking neuronal activation function, it is still a difficult problem to train brain-inspired deep SNN directly, so SNN has not yet shown performance comparable to that of an artificial neural network. For this reason, the spike-based approximate backpropagation (SABP) algorithm and a general brain-inspired SNN framework are proposed in this paper. The combination of the two can be used for end-to-end direct training of brain-inspired deep SNN. Experiments show that compared with other spike-based methods of directly training SNN, the classification accuracy of this method is close to the best results on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets and achieves the best classification accuracy on sonar image target classification (SITC) of small sample datasets. Further analysis shows that compared with artificial neural networks, our brain-inspired SNN has great advantages in computational complexity and energy consumption in sonar target classification.","['1 Henan Province Engineering Research Center of Spatial Information Processing, Kaifeng 475004, China.', '2 College of Computer and Information Engineering, Henan University, Kaifeng 475004, China.', '3 Shenzhen Research Institute, Henan University, Shenzhen 518000, China.', '4 College of Software, Henan University, Kaifeng 475004, China.', '5 Henan Key Laboratory of Big Data Analysis and Processing, Kaifeng 475004, China.', '6 Miami College, Henan University, Kaifeng 475004, China.', '7 College of Artificial Intelligence, Henan University, Zhengzhou 450046, China.']","Yang Liu, Meng Tian, Ruijia Liu, Kejing Cao, Ruiyi Wang, Yadi Wang, Wei Zhao, Yi Zhou, ",Computational intelligence and neuroscience,2022,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36313052
223,Liposuction-Augmentation Mammaplasty,"Background:
        
      
      The female breast loses superior fullness and becomes more ptotic over time. Women often present to their plastic surgeon requesting reversal of this evolution. While liposuction alone has been proven to lift the breast, no solution combining augmentation and liposuction has been reported. Objectives:
        
      
      Herein, we introduce a technique called liposuction-augmentation mammaplasty (LAM) that can achieve ""scarless"" lifting or simply volume equalization prior to inserting same-sized implants. We then compare its safety and efficacy to two gold-standard techniques with similar aims, mastopexy-augmentation mammaplasty (MAM) and reduction-augmentation mammaplasty (RAM). Methods:
        
      
      A retrospective 3-year chart review was conducted on 359 patients (652 breasts) undergoing LAM (n = 125), MAM (n = 188), and RAM (n = 46). Patient demographics, operative details, and revisions were documented. Degree of lift was measured on pre- and postoperative photographs using sternal notch-to-nipple distances (SN-N). Statistical differences were assessed between the groups. Results:
        
      
      The LAM group's mean age and OR time (37 years, 46 minutes) were significantly lower than those of MAM (43 years, 90 minutes) and RAM (42 years, 106 minutes). Mean BMIs and revision rates were uniform between the LAM and MAM groups (24, 2.5%), but significantly higher for RAM (28, 4.6%). Aspirate volumes and resection weights averaged 151 cc and 307 g (left breast) and 173 cc and 298 g (right breast). Minimum follow up was 12 months. The LAM group's mean SN-N reduction (~6%) was statistically significant, albeit much lower than MAM (~16%) and RAM (~22%). Conclusions:
        
      
      LAM is a safe, facile, reliable solution for the ptotic, fatty breast. Patients can direct their volumetric outcome and enjoy lower costs and shorter downtime.","['1 Family Medicine Resident, Saint Joseph Health System, Mishawaka, IN.', '2 plastic surgeons in private practice, Plano, TX.']","Ryan Harris, Peter Raphael, Scott W Harris, ",Aesthetic surgery journal,2018,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29045533
224,Fractional Spiking Neuron: Fractional Leaky Integrate-and-Fire Circuit Described with Dendritic Fractal Model,"As dendrites are essential parts of neurons, they are crucial factors for neuronal activities to follow multiple timescale dynamics, which ultimately affect information processing and cognition. However, in the common SNN (Spiking Neural Networks), the hardware-based LIF (Leaky Integrate-and-Fire) circuit only simulates the single timescale dynamic of soma without relating dendritic morphologies, which may limit the capability of simulating neurons to process information. This study proposes the dendritic fractal model mainly for quantifying dendritic morphological effects containing branch and length. To realize this model, We design multiple analog fractional-order circuits (AFCs) which match their extended structures and parameters with the dendritic features. Then introducing AFC into FLIF (Fractional Leaky Integrate-and-Fire) neuron circuits can demonstrate the same multiple timescale dynamics of spiking patterns as biological neurons, including spiking adaptation, inter-spike variability with power-law distribution, first-spike latency, and intrinsic memory. By contrast, it further enhances the degree of mimicry of neuron models and provides a more accurate model for understanding neural computation and cognition mechanisms.",NO_AFFILIATIONS,"Yabin Deng, Bijing Liu, Zenan Huang, Xiaojie Liu, Shan He, Qiuhong Li, Donghui Guo, ",IEEE transactions on biomedical circuits and systems,NO_DATE,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36315548
225,Learning hierarchically-structured concepts,"We use a recently developed synchronous Spiking Neural Network (SNN) model to study the problem of learning hierarchically-structured concepts. We introduce an abstract data model that describes simple hierarchical concepts. We define a feed-forward layered SNN model, with learning modeled using Oja's local learning rule, a well known biologically-plausible rule for adjusting synapse weights. We define what it means for such a network to recognize hierarchical concepts; our notion of recognition is robust, in that it tolerates a bounded amount of noise. Then, we present a learning algorithm by which a layered network may learn to recognize hierarchical concepts according to our robust definition. We analyze correctness and performance rigorously; the amount of time required to learn each concept, after learning all of the sub-concepts, is approximately O1ηkℓmaxlog(k)+1ɛ+blog(k), where k is the number of sub-concepts per concept, ℓmax is the maximum hierarchical depth, η is the learning rate, ɛ describes the amount of uncertainty allowed in robust recognition, and b describes the amount of weight decrease for ""irrelevant"" edges. An interesting feature of this algorithm is that it allows the network to learn sub-concepts in a highly interleaved manner. This algorithm assumes that the concepts are presented in a noise-free way; we also extend these results to accommodate noise in the learning process. Finally, we give a simple lower bound saying that, in order to recognize concepts with hierarchical depth two with noise-tolerance, a neural network should have at least two layers. The results in this paper represent first steps in the theoretical study of hierarchical concepts using SNNs. The cases studied here are basic, but they suggest many directions for extensions to more elaborate and realistic cases.","['1 Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA.', ""2 King's College London, London, England, United Kingdom.

Adaptability is among the characteristics of such control units, which provides the anthropomorphic hand with the ability to learn motions. This paper presents a simple structure of an adaptive spiking neural network implemented in analogue hardware that can be trained using Hebbian learning mechanisms to rotate the metacarpophalangeal joint of a robotic finger towards targeted angle intervals. Being bioinspired, the spiking neural network drives actuators made of shape memory alloy and receives feedback from neuromorphic sensors that convert the joint rotation angle and compression force into the spiking frequency. The adaptive SNN activates independent neural paths that correspond to angle intervals and learns in which of these intervals the rotation the finger rotation is stopped by an external force. Learning occurs when angle-specific neural paths are stimulated concurrently with the supraliminar stimulus that activates all the neurons that inhibit the SNN output stopping the finger. The results showed that after learning, the finger stopped in the angle interval in which the angle-specific neural path was active, without the activation of the supraliminar stimulus. The proposed concept can be used to implement control units for anthropomorphic robots that are able to learn motions unsupervised, based on principles of high biological plausibility.","['1 Faculty of Automatic Control and Computer Engineering, Gheorghe Asachi Technical University of Iasi, 700050 Iasi, Romania.']","Mircea Hulea, George Iulian Uleru, Constantin Florin Caruntu, ","Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2021,Hebbian learning; anthropomorphic finger; neuromorphic hardware; spiking neural networks.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33924453
228,Emerging neuromorphic devices,"Artificial intelligence (AI) has the ability of revolutionizing our lives and society in a radical way, by enabling machine learning in the industry, business, health, transportation, and many other fields. The ability to recognize objects, faces, and speech, requires, however, exceptional computational power and time, which is conflicting with the current difficulties in transistor scaling due to physical and architectural limitations. As a result, to accelerate the progress of AI, it is necessary to develop materials, devices, and systems that closely mimic the human brain. In this work, we review the current status and challenges on the emerging neuromorphic devices for brain-inspired computing. First, we provide an overview of the memory device technologies which have been proposed for synapse and neuron circuits in neuromorphic systems. Then, we describe the implementation of synaptic learning in the two main types of neural networks, namely the deep neural network and the spiking neural network (SNN). Bio-inspired learning, such as the spike-timing dependent plasticity scheme, is shown to enable unsupervised learning processes which are typical of the human brain. Hardware implementations of SNNs for the recognition of spatial and spatio-temporal patterns are also shown to support the cognitive computation in silico. Finally, we explore the recent advances in reproducing bio-neural processes via device physics, such as insulating-metal transitions, nanoionics drift/diffusion, and magnetization flipping in spintronic devices. By harnessing the device physics in emerging materials, neuromorphic engineering with advanced functionality, higher density and better energy efficiency can be developed.","['1 Dipartimento di Elettronica, Informazione e Bioingegneria, Politecnico di Milano and IU.NET, Piazza L. da Vinci 32 - 20133 Milano, Italy.']","Daniele Ielmini, Stefano Ambrogio, ",Nanotechnology,2020,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31698347

Over the past decades, classical gas recognition approaches such as principal component analysis (PCA) have been widely applied in E-nose systems. In recent years, artificial neural network (ANN) has revolutionized the field of E-nose, especially spiking neural network (SNN). In this paper, we investigate recent gas recognition methods for E-nose, and compare and analyze them in terms of algorithms and hardware implementations. We find each classical gas recognition method has a relatively fixed framework and a few parameters, which makes it easy to be designed and perform well with limited gas samples, but weak in multi-gas recognition under noise. While ANN-based methods obtain better recognition accuracy with flexible architectures and lots of parameters. However, some ANNs are too complex to be implemented in portable E-nose systems, such as deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). In contrast, SNN-based gas recognition methods achieve satisfying accuracy and recognize more types of gases, and could be implemented with energy-efficient hardware, which makes them a promising candidate in multi-gas identification.",NO_AFFILIATIONS,"Hong Chen, Dexuan Huo, Jilin Zhang, ",IEEE transactions on biomedical circuits and systems,NO_DATE,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35412988
231,Spiking Deep Residual Networks,"Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have received significant attention for their biological plausibility. SNNs theoretically have at least the same computational power as traditional artificial neural networks (ANNs). They possess the potential of achieving energy-efficient machine intelligence while keeping comparable performance to ANNs. However, it is still a big challenge to train a very deep SNN. In this brief, we propose an efficient approach to build deep SNNs. Residual network (ResNet) is considered a state-of-the-art and fundamental model among convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We employ the idea of converting a trained ResNet to a network of spiking neurons named spiking ResNet (S-ResNet). We propose a residual conversion model that appropriately scales continuous-valued activations in ANNs to match the firing rates in SNNs and a compensation mechanism to reduce the error caused by discretization. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet 2012 with low latency.

232,Phosphatic metabolism in dark- and light-adapted rat retinas,"This study defines retinal phosphatic metabolites and their adjustment to illumination in rat retinas under conditions that preserve retinal function. Metabolic data are measured using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and 31P nuclear magnetic resonance (31P NMR) spectroscopy after 10 min of light exposure in vivo compared with retinas from dark-adapted rats. Multiple high-energy and low-energy phosphatic metabolites of intermediary metabolism were quantified. The concentration of the high-energy phosphate adenosine triphosphate (ATP) remained unchanged from dark- to light-adaptation. Under the same conditions the concentrations of the high-energy phosphates guanosine triphosphate (GTP) and creatine phosphate increased, whereas the inorganic phosphate decreased. Comparing dark-adapted controls with retinas light-adapted either in vitro or in vivo, the evidence is consistent with a light-dependent increase in GTP and a decrease in cyclic guanosine monophosphate. Although cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels were lower in retinas light-adapted in vivo than in the dark-adapted controls, this did not seem to be an effect of light, as cAMP levels decreased similarly after 10 min incubation in dark or light in parallel with recovery of ATP/adenosine diphosphate ratios. This study: (1) reports on retinal metabolic changes with adjustment in illumination, (2) provides baseline measurements of retinal phosphatic metabolites in whole retinas, and (3) reports on the validity of chromatographic and spectroscopic methods used for studying retinal metabolism establishing a high correlation among measurements made using HPLC and 31P NMR.","['1 Clinical Eye Research of Boston, MA, USA.', '2 Department of Ophthalmology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', '3 Clinical Eye Research of Boston, MA, USA; Schepens Eye Research Institute of Massachusetts Eye and Ear, Boston, MA, USA.', '4 Clinical Eye Research of Boston, MA, USA; Schepens Eye Research Institute of Massachusetts Eye and Ear, Boston, MA, USA; Department of Ophthalmology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA; MR Laboratory, Chicago College of Osteopathic Medicine of Midwestern University, Chicago, IL, USA.

233,Representation learning using event-based STDP,"Although representation learning methods developed within the framework of traditional neural networks are relatively mature, developing a spiking representation model remains a challenging problem. This paper proposes an event-based method to train a feedforward spiking neural network (SNN) layer for extracting visual features. The method introduces a novel spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) learning rule and a threshold adjustment rule both derived from a vector quantization-like objective function subject to a sparsity constraint. The STDP rule is obtained by the gradient of a vector quantization criterion that is converted to spike-based, spatio-temporally local update rules in a spiking network of leaky, integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons. Independence and sparsity of the model are achieved by the threshold adjustment rule and by a softmax function implementing inhibition in the representation layer consisting of WTA-thresholded spiking neurons. Together, these mechanisms implement a form of spike-based, competitive learning. Two sets of experiments are performed on the MNIST and natural image datasets. The results demonstrate a sparse spiking visual representation model with low reconstruction loss comparable with state-of-the-art visual coding approaches, yet our rule is local in both time and space, thus biologically plausible and hardware friendly.","['1 The School of Computing and Informatics, University of Louisiana at Lafayette, Lafayette, LA 70504, USA.

234,First-Spike-Based Visual Categorization Using Reward-Modulated STDP,"Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently regained popularity with major achievements such as beating the European game of Go champion. Here, for the first time, we show that RL can be used efficiently to train a spiking neural network (SNN) to perform object recognition in natural images without using an external classifier. We used a feedforward convolutional SNN and a temporal coding scheme where the most strongly activated neurons fire first, while less activated ones fire later, or not at all. In the highest layers, each neuron was assigned to an object category, and it was assumed that the stimulus category was the category of the first neuron to fire. If this assumption was correct, the neuron was rewarded, i.e., spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) was applied, which reinforced the neuron's selectivity. Otherwise, anti-STDP was applied, which encouraged the neuron to learn something else. As demonstrated on various image data sets (Caltech, ETH-80, and NORB), this reward-modulated STDP (R-STDP) approach has extracted particularly discriminative visual features, whereas classic unsupervised STDP extracts any feature that consistently repeats. As a result, R-STDP has outperformed STDP on these data sets. Furthermore, R-STDP is suitable for online learning and can adapt to drastic changes such as label permutations. Finally, it is worth mentioning that both feature extraction and classification were done with spikes, using at most one spike per neuron. Thus, the network is hardware friendly and energy efficient.",NO_AFFILIATIONS,"Milad Mozafari, Saeed Reza Kheradpisheh, Timothee Masquelier, Abbas Nowzari-Dalini, Mohammad Ganjtabesh, ",IEEE transactions on neural networks and learning systems,NO_DATE,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29993898
235,Distal symmetric polyneuropathy phenotype in patients with sensory neuronopathy at the time of electrodiagnosis,"Introduction/aims:
        
      
      It is unknown how often patients with sensory neuronopathy (SNN) present with a distal symmetric polyneuropathy (DSP) phenotype. In these cases, electrodiagnostic testing may discriminate SNN with a DSP phenotype from DSP. Methods:
        
      
      We reviewed the records of patients who met SNN diagnostic criteria between January 2000 and February 2021 and identified patients with a DSP phenotype at the time of electrodiagnosis. Results:
        
      
      Sixty-two patients fulfilled SNN diagnostic criteria. At symptom onset, 20 (32.2%) patients presented with distal symmetric sensory symptoms limited to the feet. However, most progressed rapidly over 6 months or developed asymmetric symptoms. At the time of electrodiagnosis, only seven (11.3%) patients had a DSP phenotype. Of these seven patients, four had cerebellar ataxia with neuropathy and vestibular areflexia syndrome, one had vitamin B6 deficiency, one was thought to be alcohol-induced, and one was idiopathic. Discussion:
        
      
      Patients with SNN rarely present with a DSP phenotype at the time of electrodiagnosis. The finding that one third of cases resemble DSP at onset highlights the importance of clinical monitoring. In patients with a DSP phenotype, the presence of ataxia at onset or significant progression within 6 months may suggest the possibility of SNN and should prompt additional investigations, such as electrodiagnosis.","['1 Department of Neurology and Rehabilitation Medicine, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH, USA.', '2 Department of Neurology, Division of Neuromuscular Medicine, University of Michigan School of Medicine, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.']","Long Davalos, Dustin G Nowacek, Zachary N London, ",Muscle & nerve,NO_DATE,distal symmetric polyneuropathy; electrodiagnostic testing; sensory ganglionopathy; sensory neuronopathy.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34994975
236,Increased serum proteins in non-exudative AMD retinas,"The blood retinal barrier (BRB) closely regulates the retinal microenvironment. Its compromise leads to the accumulation of retinal fluid containing potentially harmful plasma components. While eyes with non-exudative age-related macular degeneration (AMD) were previously felt to have an intact BRB, we propose that the BRB in non-exudative AMD eyes may be subclinically compromised, allowing entry of retina-toxic plasma proteins. We test this hypothesis by measuring retinal levels of abundant plasma proteins that should not cross the intact BRB. Two cohorts of frozen, post mortem neurosensory retinas were studied by Western analysis. One cohort from Alabama had 4 normal controls and 4 eyes with various forms of AMD. Another cohort from Minnesota had 5 intermediate AMD eyes and 5 normals. Both cohorts were age/post mortem interval (PMI) matched. The non-exudative AMD retinas in the Alabama cohort had significantly higher levels of albumin and complement component 9 (C9) than normal controls. The positive control exudative AMD donor retina had higher levels of all but one serum protein. In both macular and peripheral neurosensory retina samples, intermediate AMD retinas in the Minnesota cohort had significantly higher levels of albumin, fibrinogen, IgG, and C9 than controls. Our results suggest that there may be moderate subclinical BRB leakage in non-exudative AMD. Potentially harmful plasma components including complement or iron could enter the neurosensory retina in AMD patients prior to advanced disease. Thus, therapies aiming to stabilize the BRB might have a role in the management of non-exudative AMD.","['1 F.M.

238,Graph Convolutional Capsule Regression (GCCR): A Model for Accelerated Filtering of Novel Potential Candidates for SARS-CoV-2 Based on Binding Affinity,"Background:
        
      
      There has been a growing interest in discovering a viable drug for the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) since the beginning of the pandemic. Protein-ligand interaction studies are a crucial step in the drug discovery process, as it helps us narrow the search space for potential ligands with high drug-likeness. Derivatives of popular drugs like Remdesivir generated through tools employing evolutionary algorithms are usually considered potential candidates. However, screening promising molecules from such a large search space is difficult. In a conventional screening process, for each ligand-target pair, there are time-consuming interaction studies that use docking simulations before downstream tasks like thermodynamic, kinetic, and electrostatic-potential evaluation. Methods:
        
      
      In this work, 'Graph Convolutional Capsule Regression' (GCCR), a model which uses Capsule Neural Networks (CapsNet) and Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) to predict the binding energy of a protein-ligand complex is being proposed. The model's predictions were further validated with kinetic and free energy studies like Molecular Dynamics (MD) for kinetic stability and MM/GBSA analysis for free energy calculations. Results:
        
      
      The GCCR showed an RMSE value of 0.0978 for 81.3% of the concordance index. The RMSE of GCCR converged around the iteration of just 50 epochs scoring a lower RMSE than GCN and GAT. When training with Davis Dataset, GCCR gave an RMSE score of 0.3806 with a CI score of 87.5%. Conclusion:
        
      
      The proposed GCCR model shows great potential in improving the screening process based on binding affinity and outperforms baseline machine learning models like DeepDTA, KronRLS, SimBoost, and other Graph Neural Networks (GNN) based models like Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) and Graph Attention Networks (GAT).","['1 Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham computer science and engineering coimbatore India.', '2 Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham University COMPUTER SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING Coimbatore India.']","Aravind Krishnan, Dayanand Vinod, ",Current computer-aided drug design,2023,Binding Affinity Prediction; COVID-19; Drug Discovery; Graph Neural Network; MD simulation; MM/GBSA; SARS-CoV-2; molecular docking.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37005531
239,Single-cell transcriptomic atlas of the human retina identifies cell types associated with age-related macular degeneration,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified genetic variants associated with age-related macular degeneration (AMD), one of the leading causes of blindness in the elderly. However, it has been challenging to identify the cell types associated with AMD given the genetic complexity of the disease. Here we perform massively parallel single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of human retinas using two independent platforms, and report the first single-cell transcriptomic atlas of the human retina. Using a multi-resolution network-based analysis, we identify all major retinal cell types, and their corresponding gene expression signatures. Heterogeneity is observed within macroglia, suggesting that human retinal glia are more diverse than previously thought. Finally, GWAS-based enrichment analysis identifies glia, vascular cells, and cone photoreceptors to be associated with the risk of AMD. These data provide a detailed analysis of the human retina, and show how scRNA-seq can provide insight into cell types involved in complex, inflammatory genetic diseases.","['1 Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, 02142, USA.', '2 Departments of Ophthalmology and Neurology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, 02115, USA.', '3 Evergrande Center for Immunologic Diseases, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, 02115, USA.', '4 MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, Cambridge, MA, 02139, USA.', '5 Institute for Medical Engineering and Science and Department of Chemistry, MIT, Cambridge, MA, 02139, USA.', '6 Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research, MIT, Cambridge, MA, 02142, USA.', '7 Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, 02139, USA.', '8 Department of Pathology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, 02114, USA.', '9 Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, 02142, USA. brian.hafler@yale.edu.', '10 Departments of Ophthalmology and Neurology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, 02115, USA. brian.hafler@yale.edu.', '11 Evergrande Center for Immunologic Diseases, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, 02115, USA. brian.hafler@yale.edu.', '12 Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Science, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, 06510, USA. brian.hafler@yale.edu.']","Madhvi Menon, Shahin Mohammadi, Jose Davila-Velderrain, Brittany A Goods, Tanina D Cadwell, Yu Xing, Anat Stemmer-Rachamimov, Alex K Shalek, John Christopher Love, Manolis Kellis, Brian P Hafler, ",Nature communications,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31653841

Due to the recent outbreak of novel coronavirus pneumonia, novel chest X-ray (CXR) images that can be used for deep learning analysis are very rare. To solve this problem, we propose a deep learning framework that integrates a convolutional neural network and a capsule network. DenseCapsNet, a new deep learning framework, is formed by the fusion of a dense convolutional network (DenseNet) and the capsule neural network (CapsNet), leveraging their respective advantages and reducing the dependence of convolutional neural networks on a large amount of data. Using 750 CXR images of lungs of healthy patients as well as those of patients with other pneumonia and novel coronavirus pneumonia, the method can obtain an accuracy of 90.7% and an F1 score of 90.9%, and the sensitivity for detecting COVID-19 can reach 96%. These results show that the deep fusion neural network DenseCapsNet has good performance in novel coronavirus pneumonia CXR radiography detection.","['1 College of Medicine and Biological Information Engineering, Northeastern University, Shenyang, 110001, China.

242,Detecting Pneumonia using Convolutions and Dynamic Capsule Routing for Chest X-ray Images,"An entity's existence in an image can be depicted by the activity instantiation vector from a group of neurons (called capsule). Recently, multi-layered capsules, called CapsNet, have proven to be state-of-the-art for image classification tasks. This research utilizes the prowess of this algorithm to detect pneumonia from chest X-ray (CXR) images. Here, an entity in the CXR image can help determine if the patient (whose CXR is used) is suffering from pneumonia or not. A simple model of capsules (also known as Simple CapsNet) has provided results comparable to best Deep Learning models that had been used earlier. Subsequently, a combination of convolutions and capsules is used to obtain two models that outperform all models previously proposed. These models-Integration of convolutions with capsules (ICC) and Ensemble of convolutions with capsules (ECC)-detect pneumonia with a test accuracy of 95.33% and 95.90%, respectively. The latter model is studied in detail to obtain a variant called EnCC, where n = 3, 4, 8, 16. Here, the E4CC model works optimally and gives test accuracy of 96.36%.

243,"Sensory neuronopathies, diagnostic criteria and causes","Purpose of review:
        
      
      To stress on the diagnostic strategy of sensory neuronopathies (SNN), including new genes and antibodies. Recent finding:
        
      
      SNN involve paraneoplastic, dysimmune, toxic, viral and genetic mechanisms. About one-third remains idiopathic. Recently, new antibodies and genes have reduced this proportion. Anti-FGFR3 and anti-AGO antibodies are not specific of SNN, although SNN is predominant and may occur with systemic autoimmune diseases. These antibodies are the only marker of an underlying dysimmune context in two-thirds (anti-FGFR3 antibodies) and one-third of the cases (anti-AGO antibodies), respectively. Patients with anti-AGO antibodies may improve with treatment, which is less clear with anti-FGFR3 antibodies. A biallelic expansion in the RFC1 gene is responsible for the cerebellar ataxia, neuropathy, vestibular areflexia syndrome (CANVAS) in which SNN is a predominant manifestation. Most of the patients have an adult onset and are sporadic. The RFC1 mutation may represent one-third of idiopathic sensory neuropathies. Finally, the criteria for the diagnosis of paraneoplastic SNN have recently been updated. Summary:
        
      
      The diagnostic of SNN relies on criteria distinguishing SNN from other neuropathies. The strategy in search of their cause now needs to include these recent findings.","['1 University Hospital of Saint-Etienne, European Reference Network for Rare Diseases- Euro-NMD, INSERM U1314/CNRS UMR 5284, Université Claude Bernard Lyon 1, Lyon, France.']","Jean-Christophe Antoine, ",Current opinion in neurology,2022,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35950727

Mammogram is an efficient technique used for screening and identification of abnormalities over the breast region. Earlier identification of breast cancer enhances the prognosis of patients and is mainly based on the experience of the radiologist in interpretation of mammogram with quality of image. The advent of Deep Learning (DL) and Computer Vision techniques is widely used to perform breast cancer diagnosis. This paper presents a new Optimal Multi-Level Thresholding-based Segmentation with DL enabled Capsule Network (OMLTS-DLCN) breast cancer diagnosis model utilizing digital mammograms.

In addition, the proposed model involves a CapsNet based feature extractor and Back-Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) classification model is employed to detect the existence of breast cancer. The diagnostic outcomes of the presented OMLTS-DLCN technique is examined by means of benchmark Mini-MIAS dataset and DDSM dataset.

246,Attention Spiking Neural Networks,"Brain-inspired spiking neural networks (SNNs) are becoming a promising energy-efficient alternative to traditional artificial neural networks (ANNs). However, the performance gap between SNNs and ANNs has been a significant hindrance to deploying SNNs ubiquitously. To leverage the full potential of SNNs, in this paper we study the attention mechanisms, which can help human focus on important information. We present our idea of attention in SNNs with a multi-dimensional attention module, which infers attention weights along the temporal, channel, as well as spatial dimension separately or simultaneously. Based on the existing neuroscience theories, we exploit the attention weights to optimize membrane potentials, which in turn regulate the spiking response. Extensive experimental results on event-based action recognition and image classification datasets demonstrate that attention facilitates vanilla SNNs to achieve sparser spiking firing, better performance, and energy efficiency concurrently. In particular, we achieve top-1 accuracy of 75.92% and 77.08% on ImageNet-1K with single/4-step Res-SNN-104, which are state-of-the-art results in SNNs. Compared with counterpart Res-ANN-104, the performance gap becomes -0.95/+0.21 percent and the energy efficiency is 31.8×/7.4×. To analyze the effectiveness of attention SNNs, we theoretically prove that the spiking degradation or the gradient vanishing, which usually holds in general SNNs, can be resolved by introducing the block dynamical isometry theory. We also analyze the efficiency of attention SNNs based on our proposed spiking response visualization method.

247,Backpropagation With Sparsity Regularization for Spiking Neural Network Learning,"The spiking neural network (SNN) is a possible pathway for low-power and energy-efficient processing and computing exploiting spiking-driven and sparsity features of biological systems. This article proposes a sparsity-driven SNN learning algorithm, namely backpropagation with sparsity regularization (BPSR), aiming to achieve improved spiking and synaptic sparsity. Backpropagation incorporating spiking regularization is utilized to minimize the spiking firing rate with guaranteed accuracy. Backpropagation realizes the temporal information capture and extends to the spiking recurrent layer to support brain-like structure learning. The rewiring mechanism with synaptic regularization is suggested to further mitigate the redundancy of the network structure. Rewiring based on weight and gradient regulates the pruning and growth of synapses. Experimental results demonstrate that the network learned by BPSR has synaptic sparsity and is highly similar to the biological system. It not only balances the accuracy and firing rate, but also facilitates SNN learning by suppressing the information redundancy. We evaluate the proposed BPSR on the visual dataset MNIST, N-MNIST, and CIFAR10, and further test it on the sensor dataset MIT-BIH and gas sensor. Results bespeak that our algorithm achieves comparable or superior accuracy compared to related works, with sparse spikes and synapses.","['1 School of Information Science and Technology, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.']","Yulong Yan, Haoming Chu, Yi Jin, Yuxiang Huan, Zhuo Zou, Lirong Zheng, ",Frontiers in neuroscience,2022,backpropagation; sparsity regularization; spiking neural network; spiking sparsity; synaptic sparsity.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35495028

      Male C57BL/6J mice fed with a high-fat diet (HFD) were used to establish the NAFLD model. Dynamic changes of mice including body weight, liver weight, serological biochemical indexes, liver histopathological changes, and protein level of AMPK and SIRT1 were monitored. After18 weeks, SNN treatment was administrated to the NAFLD mice for another 4 weeks. Besides the aforementioned indices, TC and TG of liver tissues were also measured. Western blot and quantitative RT-PCR were used to detect the expression and/or activation of SIRT1 and AMPK, as well as the molecules associated with lipid synthesis and β-oxidation. Furthermore, AML12 cells with lipid accumulation induced by fatty acids were treated with LZG and EX527 (SIRT1 inhibitor) or Compound C (AMPK inhibitor ) to confirm the potential pharmacological mechanism. Results:
        
      
      Dynamic observation found the mice induced by HFD with gradually increased body and liver weight, elevated serum cholesterol, hepatic lipid accumulation, and liver injury. After 16 weeks, these indicators have shown obvious changes. Additionally, the hepatic level of SIRT1 and AMPK activation was identified gradually decreased with NAFLD progress. The mice with SNN administration had lower body weight, liver weight, and serum level of LDL-c and ALT than those of the NAFLD model. Hepatosteatosis and hepatic TG content in the liver tissues of the SNN group were significantly reduced. When compared with control mice, the NAFLD mice had significantly decreased hepatic expression of SIRT1, p-AMPK, p-ACC, ACOX1, and increased total Acetylated-lysine, SUV39H2, and SREBP-1c. The administration of SNN reversed the expression of these molecules. In vitro experiments showed the effect of SNN in ameliorating hepatosteatosis and regulating the expression of lipid metabolism-related genes in AML12 cells, which were diminished by EX527 or Compound C co-incubation. Conclusions:
        
      
      Taken together, the SIRT1/AMPK signaling pathway, involved in hepatic lipid synthesis and degradation, plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of NAFLD development. The regulation of SIRT1/AMPK signaling greatly contributes to the underlying therapeutic mechanism of SNN for NAFLD.","['1 Institute of Digestive Diseases, Longhua Hospital, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai, 200032, China.', '2 Teaching Experiment Center, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai, 201203, China.', '3 Department II of Digestive Diseases, Longhua Hospital, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai, 200120, China.', '4 Institute of Digestive Diseases, Longhua Hospital, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai, 200032, China. songhy@126.com.', '5 Institute of Digestive Diseases, Longhua Hospital, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai, 200032, China. zpychina@sina.com.']","Yang Liu, Yiping Li, Jue Wang, Lili Yang, Xiao Yu, Ping Huang, Haiyan Song, Peiyong Zheng, ",BMC complementary medicine and therapies,2022,AMPK; Lipid metabolism; Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease; SIRT1; Salvia-Nelumbinis naturalis.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35945571
249,Agreement in Spiking Neural Networks,"We study the problem of binary agreement in a spiking neural network (SNN). We show that binary agreement on n inputs can be achieved with O(n) of auxiliary neurons. Our simulation results suggest that agreement can be achieved in our network in O(logn) time. We then describe a subclass of SNNs with a biologically plausible property, which we call size-independence. We prove that solving a class of problems, including agreement and Winner-Take-All, in this model requires Ω(n) auxiliary neurons, which makes our agreement network size-optimal.","['1 LTCI, Télécom Paris, Institut Polytechnique de Paris, Palaiseau, France.', '2 Institut de la Vision, INSERM, CNRS, Sorbonne Université, Paris, France.']","Martin Kunev, Petr Kuznetsov, Denis Sheynikhovich, ",Journal of computational biology : a journal of computational molecular cell biology,NO_DATE,binary agreement; complexity; consensus; spiking neural network; winner-take-all.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35333601
250,Blockchain-Federated and Deep-Learning-Based Ensembling of Capsule Network with Incremental Extreme Learning Machines for Classification of COVID-19 Using CT Scans,"Due to the rapid rate of SARS-CoV-2 dissemination, a conversant and effective strategy must be employed to isolate COVID-19. When it comes to determining the identity of COVID-19, one of the most significant obstacles that researchers must overcome is the rapid propagation of the virus, in addition to the dearth of trustworthy testing models. This problem continues to be the most difficult one for clinicians to deal with. The use of AI in image processing has made the formerly insurmountable challenge of finding COVID-19 situations more manageable. In the real world, there is a problem that has to be handled about the difficulties of sharing data between hospitals while still honoring the privacy concerns of the organizations. When training a global deep learning (DL) model, it is crucial to handle fundamental concerns such as user privacy and collaborative model development. For this study, a novel framework is designed that compiles information from five different databases (several hospitals) and edifies a global model using blockchain-based federated learning (FL). The data is validated through the use of blockchain technology (BCT), and FL trains the model on a global scale while maintaining the secrecy of the organizations. The proposed framework is divided into three parts. First, we provide a method of data normalization that can handle the diversity of data collected from five different sources using several computed tomography (CT) scanners. Second, to categorize COVID-19 patients, we ensemble the capsule network (CapsNet) with incremental extreme learning machines (IELMs). Thirdly, we provide a strategy for interactively training a global model using BCT and FL while maintaining anonymity. Extensive tests employing chest CT scans and a comparison of the classification performance of the proposed model to that of five DL algorithms for predicting COVID-19, while protecting the privacy of the data for a variety of users, were undertaken. Our findings indicate improved effectiveness in identifying COVID-19 patients and achieved an accuracy of 98.99%. Thus, our model provides substantial aid to medical practitioners in their diagnosis of COVID-19.","['1 Department of Computer Science, University of Management and Technology, Lahore 54000, Pakistan.', '2 Department of Software Engineering, University of Management and Technology, Lahore 54000, Pakistan.', '3 Department of Unmanned Vehicle Engineering, Sejong University, Seoul 05006, Republic of Korea.', '4 School of Computing, Gachon University, Seongnam 13120, Republic of Korea.']","Hassaan Malik, Tayyaba Anees, Ahmad Naeem, Rizwan Ali Naqvi, Woong-Kee Loh, ","Bioengineering (Basel, Switzerland)",2023,COVID-19; CT scans; blockchain; data privacy; deep learning; federated learning.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36829697
251,A deep capsule neural network with data augmentation generative adversarial networks for single and simultaneous fault diagnosis of wind turbine gearbox,"The fault diagnosis (FD) of wind turbine gearbox (WTG) is of special importance for keeping the wind turbine drivetrain working normally and safely. However, owing to the limited training data and the mutual interference of various mechanical parts, it is of great difficulty to realize the simultaneous-fault monitoring task of WTG using existing intelligent FD methods or manual inspection-based approaches. To tackle the issue, a deep capsule neural network with data augmentation generative adversarial networks, named ST-DAGANs-CapNet, is developed for the single and simultaneous FD of WTG by integrating capsule neural network (CapsNet) with Stockwell transform (ST) and data augmentation generative adversarial networks (DAGANs). The proposed ST-DAGANs-CapNet method mainly consists of three steps. First of all, ST is adopted to extract two-dimension (2-d) image features of time-frequency domain from raw time-domain vibration signals of WTG. Then, DAGANs are employed for generating more fake image samples to address the problem of lacking training data. At last, the built CapsNet model is utilized to diagnose the single and compound faults of WTG by the primary 2-d feature images and the made fake 2-d feature images in training set. Two experimental studies are implemented to prove the effectiveness of the proposed method, and the result is compared with some existing intelligent FD of WTG. It indicates that DAGANs are effective in helping to tackle the issue of limited and unbalanced training samples in real FD of WTG, and the diagnosis result of the proposed approach in test sample set is better than that of several commonly used FD methods in literatures.","['1 School of Mechanical Engineering, Yanshan University, Qinhuangdao, China.

Merging biomimetic sensing with weight-updating capabilities in artificial synaptic devices represents one of the key research focuses. Here, we report a multiresponsive synapse device that integrates synaptic and optical-sensing functions. The device adopts vertically stacked graphene/h-BN/WSe2 heterostructures, including an ultrahigh-mobility readout layer, a weight-control layer, and a dual-stimuli-responsive layer. The unique structure endows synapse devices with excellent synaptic plasticity, short response time (3 μs), and excellent optical responsivity (105 A/W). To demonstrate the application in neuromorphic computing, handwritten digit recognition was simulated based on an unsupervised spiking neural network (SNN) with a precision of 90.89%, well comparable with the state-of-the-art results. Furthermore, multiterminal neuromorphic devices are demonstrated to mimic dendritic integration and photoswitching logic.

253,Bio-Inspired Control System for Fingers Actuated by Multiple SMA Actuators,"Spiking neural networks are able to control with high precision the rotation and force of single-joint robotic arms when shape memory alloy wires are used for actuation. Bio-inspired robotic arms such as anthropomorphic fingers include more junctions that are actuated simultaneously. Starting from the hypothesis that the motor cortex groups the control of multiple muscles into neural synergies, this work presents for the first time an SNN structure that is able to control a series of finger motions by activation of groups of neurons that drive the corresponding actuators in sequence. The initial motion starts when a command signal is received, while the subsequent ones are initiated based on the sensors' output. In order to increase the biological plausibility of the control system, the finger is flexed and extended by four SMA wires connected to the phalanges as the main tendons. The results show that the artificial finger that is controlled by the SNN is able to smoothly perform several motions of the human index finger while the command signal is active. To evaluate the advantages of using SNN, we compared the finger behaviours when the SMA actuators are driven by SNN, and by a microcontroller, respectively. In addition, we designed an electronic circuit that models the sensor's output in concordance with the SNN output.","['1 Department of Computer Engineering, Gheorghe Asachi Technical University of Iasi, 700050 Iasi, Romania.', '2 Department of Automatic Control, Gheorghe Asachi Technical University of Iasi, 700050 Iasi, Romania.']","George-Iulian Uleru, Mircea Hulea, Adrian Burlacu, ","Biomimetics (Basel, Switzerland)",2022,anthropomorphic finger; biomimetic motions; multiple SMA actuators; spiking neural networks.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35645189

One of the core problems in neuroprosthesis study is to construct a neural signal transformation model from one cortical area to another. Since the brain encodes and transmits information in spike trains, spiking neural network (SNN) can be an ideal choice for neuroprosthesis modeling. This paper proposes a spiking neuron point-process model (SNPM), which receives spike times as input, and is capable of modeling nonlinear interactions between cortical areas. The proposed SNPM can be implemented on neuromorphic chips for low-energy computing, thus has potential for clinical applications. Experiments show that SNPM can accurately reconstruct functional relationships from PMd (dorsal premotor cortex) to M1 (primary motor cortex) areas.",NO_AFFILIATIONS,"Weihan Li, Cunle Qian, Yu Qi, Yiwen Wang, Yueming Wang, Gang Pan, ",Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society.

255,Event-Driven Intrinsic Plasticity for Spiking Convolutional Neural Networks,"The biologically discovered intrinsic plasticity (IP) learning rule, which changes the intrinsic excitability of an individual neuron by adaptively turning the firing threshold, has been shown to be crucial for efficient information processing. However, this learning rule needs extra time for updating operations at each step, causing extra energy consumption and reducing the computational efficiency. The event-driven or spike-based coding strategy of spiking neural networks (SNNs), i.e., neurons will only be active if driven by continuous spiking trains, employs all-or-none pulses (spikes) to transmit information, contributing to sparseness in neuron activations. In this article, we propose two event-driven IP learning rules, namely, input-driven and self-driven IP, based on basic IP learning. Input-driven means that IP updating occurs only when the neuron receives spiking inputs from its presynaptic neurons, whereas self-driven means that IP updating only occurs when the neuron generates a spike. A spiking convolutional neural network (SCNN) is developed based on the ANN2SNN conversion method, i.e., converting a well-trained rate-based artificial neural network to an SNN via directly mapping the connection weights. By comparing the computational performance of SCNNs with different IP rules on the recognition of MNIST, FashionMNIST, Cifar10, and SVHN datasets, we demonstrate that the two event-based IP rules can remarkably reduce IP updating operations, contributing to sparse computations and accelerating the recognition process.

By mimicking a biological gustatory neuron, the proposed E-tongue can simultaneously detect ion concentrations of chemicals on an extended gate and encode spike signals on the MOSFET, which acts as an input neuron in a spiking neural network (SNN). Such in-sensor neuromorphic functioning can reduce the energy and area consumption of the conventional E-tongue hardware. pH-sensitive and sodium-sensitive artificial gustatory neurons are implemented by using two different sensing materials: Al2O3 for pH sensing and sodium ionophore X for sodium ion sensing. In addition, a sensitivity control function inspired by the biological sensory neuron is demonstrated. After the unit device characterization of the artificial gustatory neuron, a fully hardware-based E-tongue that can classify two distinct liquids is demonstrated to show a practical application of the artificial gustatory neurons.","['1 School of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), 291 Daehak-ro, Yuseong-gu, Daejeon 34141, Republic of Korea.', '2 Department of Electronics Engineering, Chungnam National University, 99 Daehak-ro, Yuseong-gu, Daejeon 34134, Republic of Korea.']","Joon-Kyu Han, Sang-Chan Park, Ji-Man Yu, Jae-Hyuk Ahn, Yang-Kyu Choi, ",Nano letters,2022,Biosensor; electronic tongue; gustatory neuron; neuromorphic; spiking neural network (SNN).,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35737524

259,"A Little Energy Goes a Long Way: Build an Energy-Efficient, Accurate Spiking Neural Network From Convolutional Neural Network","This article conforms to a recent trend of developing an energy-efficient Spiking Neural Network (SNN), which takes advantage of the sophisticated training regime of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and converts a well-trained CNN to an SNN. We observe that the existing CNN-to-SNN conversion algorithms may keep a certain amount of residual current in the spiking neurons in SNN, and the residual current may cause significant accuracy loss when inference time is short. To deal with this, we propose a unified framework to equalize the output of the convolutional or dense layer in CNN and the accumulated current in SNN, and maximally align the spiking rate of a neuron with its corresponding charge. This framework enables us to design a novel explicit current control (ECC) method for the CNN-to-SNN conversion which considers multiple objectives at the same time during the conversion, including accuracy, latency, and energy efficiency. We conduct an extensive set of experiments on different neural network architectures, e.g., VGG, ResNet, and DenseNet, to evaluate the resulting SNNs. The benchmark datasets include not only the image datasets such as CIFAR-10/100 and ImageNet but also the Dynamic Vision Sensor (DVS) image datasets such as DVS-CIFAR-10.

260,Disentangled Capsule Routing for Fast Part-Object Relational Saliency,"Recently, the Part-Object Relational (POR) saliency underpinned by the Capsule Network (CapsNet) has been demonstrated to be an effective modeling mechanism to improve the saliency detection accuracy. However, it is widely known that the current capsule routing operations have huge computational complexity, which seriously limited the usability of the POR saliency models in real-time applications. To this end, this paper takes an early step towards a fast POR saliency inference by proposing a novel disentangled part-object relational network. Concretely, we disentangle horizontal routing and vertical routing from the original omnidirectional capsule routing, thus generating Disentangled Capsule Routing (DCR). This mechanism enjoys two advantages. On one hand, DCR that disentangles orthogonal 1D (i.e., vertical and horizontal) routing greatly reduces parameters and routing complexity, resulting in much faster inference than omnidirectional 2D routing adopted by existing CapsNets. On the other hand, thanks to the light POR cues explored by DCR, we could conveniently integrate the part-object routing process to different feature layers in CNN, rather than just applying it to the small-scaled one as in previous works. This helps to increase saliency inference accuracy. Compared to previous POR saliency detectors, DPORTNet infers visual saliency (5 ∼ 9 ) × faster, and is more accurate.

261,Antimicrobial and Structural Properties of Metal Ions Complexes with Thiosemicarbazide Motif and Related Heterocyclic Compounds,"Antibiotic resistance acquired by various bacterial fungal and viral pathogens poses therapeutic problems of increasing severity. Among the infections that are very difficult to treat, biofilm-associated cases are one of the most hazardous. Complex structure of a biofilm and unique physiology of the biofilm cells contribute to their extremely high resistance to environmental conditions, antimicrobial agents and the mechanisms of host immune response. Therefore, the biofilm formation, especially by multidrugresistant pathogens, is a serious medical problem, playing a pivotal role in the development of chronic and recurrent infections. These factors create a limitation for using traditional chemiotherapeutics and contribute to a request for development of new approaches for treatment of infectious diseases. Therefore, early reports on antimicrobial activity of several complexes of metal ions, bearing thiosemicarbazide or thiosemicarbazones as the ligands, gave a boost to worldwide search for new, more efficient compounds of this class, to be used as alternatives to commonly known drugs. In general, depending on the presence of other heteroatoms, these ligands may function in a di-, tri- or tetradentate forms (e.g., of N,S,-, N,N,S-, N,N,N,S-, N,N,S,S-, or N,S,O-type), which impose different coordination geometries to the resultant complexes. In the first part of this review, we describe the ways of synthesis and the structures of the ligands based on the thiosemicarbazone motif, while the second part deals with the antimicrobial activity of their complexes with selected metal ions.","['1 Department of Cosmetic Raw Materials Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, Medical University of Lodz, Muszynskiego 1, 90-151 Lodz, Poland.', '2 Collegium Medicum in Bydgoszcz, Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toruń, Faculty of Pharmacy, Department of Inorganic and Analytical Chemistry, 85-094 Bydgoszcz, Poland.', '3 Department of Theoretical and Structural Chemistry, Faculty of Chemistry, University of Lodz, Pomorska 163/165, 90-236 Lodz, Poland.', '4 Centre of Molecular and Macromolecular Studies, Polish Academy of Sciences, Department of Bioorganic Chemistry, Sienkiewicza 112, 90-363 Lodz, Poland.', '5 Department of Immunology and Infectious Biology, Faculty of Biology and Environmental Protection, University of Lodz, Banacha 12/16, 90-237 Lodz, Poland.']","Ewelina Namiecińska, Marta Sobiesiak, Magdalena Małecka, Piotr Guga, Barbara Rozalska, Elzbieta Budzisz, ",Current medicinal chemistry,NO_DATE,Thiosemicarbazide derivatives; antibacterial; antibiotic-resistance; antifungal; antimicrobial properties; antiviral; structures of metal ions complexes; thiosemicarbazone..,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29493443
262,Anti-AGO1 Antibodies Identify a Subset of Autoimmune Sensory Neuronopathy,"Background and objectives:
        
      
      Autoantibodies (Abs) improve diagnosis and treatment decisions of idiopathic neurologic disorders. Recently, we identified Abs against Argonaute (AGO) proteins as potential autoimmunity biomarkers in neurologic disorders. In this study, we aim to reveal (1) the frequency of AGO1 Abs in sensory neuronopathy (SNN), (2) titers and IgG subclasses, and (3) their clinical pattern including response to treatment. Methods:
        
      
      This retrospective multicentric case/control study screened 132 patients with SNN, 301 with non-SNN neuropathies, 274 with autoimmune diseases (AIDs), and 116 healthy controls (HCs) for AGO1 Abs through ELISA. Seropositive cases were also tested for IgG subclasses, titers, and conformation specificity. Results:
        
      
      AGO1 Abs occurred in 44 patients, comprising significantly more of those with SNN (17/132 [12.9%]) than those with non-SNN neuropathies (11/301 [3.7%]; p = 0.001), those with AIDs (16/274 [5.8%]; p = 0.02), or HCs (0/116; p < 0.0001). Ab titers ranged from 1:100 to 1:100,000. IgG subclass was mainly IgG1, and 11/17 AGO1 Ab-positive SNN (65%) had a conformational epitope. AGO1 Ab-positive SNN was more severe than AGO1 Ab-negative SNN (e.g., SNN score: 12.2 vs 11.0, p = 0.004), and they more frequently and more efficiently responded to immunomodulatory treatments than AGO1 Ab-negative SNN (7/13 [54%] vs 6/37 [16%], p = 0.02). Regarding the type of treatments more precisely, this significant difference was confirmed for the use of IV immunoglobulins (IVIg) but not for steroids or second-line treatments. Multivariate logistic regression adjusted for potential confounders showed that AGO1 Ab positivity was the only predictor of response to treatment (OR 4.93, 1.10-22.24 95% CI, p = 0.03).

264,Oxide-Based Electrolyte-Gated Transistors for Spatiotemporal Information Processing,"Spiking neural networks (SNNs) sharing large similarity with biological nervous systems are promising to process spatiotemporal information and can provide highly time- and energy-efficient computational paradigms for the Internet-of-Things and edge computing. Nonvolatile electrolyte-gated transistors (EGTs) provide prominent analog switching performance, the most critical feature of synaptic element, and have been recently demonstrated as a promising synaptic device. However, high performance, large-scale EGT arrays, and EGT application for spatiotemporal information processing in an SNN are yet to be demonstrated. Here, an oxide-based EGT employing amorphous Nb2 O5 and Lix SiO2 is introduced as the channel and electrolyte gate materials, respectively, and integrated into a 32 × 32 EGT array. The engineered EGTs show a quasi-linear update, good endurance (106 ) and retention, a high switching speed of 100 ns, ultralow readout conductance (<100 nS), and ultralow areal switching energy density (20 fJ µm-2 ). The prominent analog switching performance is leveraged for hardware implementation of an SNN with the capability of spatiotemporal information processing, where spike sequences with different timings are able to be efficiently learned and recognized by the EGT array. Finally, this EGT-based spatiotemporal information processing is deployed to detect moving orientation in a tactile sensing system. These results provide an insight into oxide-based EGT devices for energy-efficient neuromorphic computing to support edge application.","['1 Key Laboratory of Microelectronic Devices and Integrated Technology, Institute of Microelectronics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100029, China.', '2 University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100049, China.', '3 School of Microelectronics, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui, 230026, China.', '4 Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, The University of Hong Kong, Pok Fu Lam Road, Hong Kong.', '5 Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, MA, 01003, USA.']","Yue Li, Jikai Lu, Dashan Shang, Qi Liu, Shuyu Wu, Zuheng Wu, Xumeng Zhang, Jianguo Yang, Zhongrui Wang, Hangbing Lv, Ming Liu, ","Advanced materials (Deerfield Beach, Fla.)",NO_DATE,analog switching; electrolyte-gated transistors ion intercalation; spatiotemporal information processing.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33079425
265,Adversarial robustness assessment: Why in evaluation both L0 and L∞ attacks are necessary,"There are different types of adversarial attacks and defences for machine learning algorithms which makes assessing the robustness of an algorithm a daunting task. Moreover, there is an intrinsic bias in these adversarial attacks and defences to make matters worse. Here, we organise the problems faced: a) Model Dependence, b) Insufficient Evaluation, c) False Adversarial Samples, and d) Perturbation Dependent Results. Based on this, we propose a model agnostic adversarial robustness assessment method based on L0 and L∞ distance-based norms and the concept of robustness levels to tackle the problems. We validate our robustness assessment on several neural network architectures (WideResNet, ResNet, AllConv, DenseNet, NIN, LeNet and CapsNet) and adversarial defences for image classification problem. The proposed robustness assessment reveals that the robustness may vary significantly depending on the metric used (i.e., L0 or L∞). Hence, the duality should be taken into account for a correct evaluation. Moreover, a mathematical derivation and a counter-example suggest that L1 and L2 metrics alone are not sufficient to avoid spurious adversarial samples. Interestingly, the threshold attack of the proposed assessment is a novel L∞ black-box adversarial method which requires even more minor perturbation than the One-Pixel Attack (only 12% of One-Pixel Attack's amount of perturbation) to achieve similar results. We further show that all current networks and defences are vulnerable at all levels of robustness, suggesting that current networks and defences are only effective against a few attacks keeping the models vulnerable to different types of attacks.","['1 Department of Information Science and Engineering, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan.', '2 Department of Electrical Engineering and Information Systems, School of Engineering, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.']","Shashank Kotyan, Danilo Vasconcellos Vargas, ",PloS one,2022,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35421125
266,BSNN: Towards faster and better conversion of artificial neural networks to spiking neural networks with bistable neurons,"The spiking neural network (SNN) computes and communicates information through discrete binary events. Recent work has achieved essential progress on an excellent performance by converting ANN to SNN. Due to the difference in information processing, the converted deep SNN usually suffers serious performance loss and large time delay. In this paper, we analyze the reasons for the performance loss and propose a novel bistable spiking neural network (BSNN) that addresses the problem of the phase lead and phase lag. Also, we design synchronous neurons (SN) to help efficiently improve performance when ResNet structure-based ANNs are converted. BSNN significantly improves the performance of the converted SNN by enabling more accurate delivery of information to the next layer after one cycle. Experimental results show that the proposed method only needs 1/4-1/10 of the time steps compared to previous work to achieve nearly lossless conversion. We demonstrate better ANN-SNN conversion for VGG16, ResNet20, and ResNet34 on challenging datasets including CIFAR-10 (95.16% top-1), CIFAR-100 (78.12% top-1), and ImageNet (72.64% top-1).","['1 Research Center for Brain-Inspired Intelligence, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.', '2 School of Artificial Intelligence, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.', '3 Center for Excellence in Brain Science and Intelligence Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China.', '4 National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.']","Yang Li, Dongcheng Zhao, Yi Zeng, ",Frontiers in neuroscience,2022,bistability; conversion; image classification; neuromorphic computing; spiking neural network.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36312025
267,Early Termination Based Training Acceleration for an Energy-Efficient SNN Processor Design,"In this paper, we present a novel early termination based training acceleration technique for temporal coding based spiking neural network (SNN) processor design. The proposed early termination scheme can efficiently identify the non-contributing training images during the training's feedforward process, and it skips the rest of the processes to save training energy and time. A metric to evaluate each input image's contribution to training has been developed, and it is compared with pre-determined threshold to decide whether to skip the rest of the training process. For the threshold selection, an adaptive threshold calculation method is presented to increase the computation skip ratio without sacrificing accuracy. Timestep splitting approach is also employed to allow more frequent early termination in split timesteps, thus leading to more computation savings. The proposed early termination and timestep splitting techniques achieve 51.21/42.31/93.53/30.36% reduction of synaptic operations and 86.06/64.63/90.82/49.14% reduction of feedforward timestep for the training process on MNIST/Fashion-MNIST/ETH-80/EMNIST-Letters dataset, respectively. The hardware implementation of the proposed SNN processor using 28 nm CMOS process shows that the SNN processor achieves the training energy saving of 61.76/31.88% and computation cycle reduction of 69.10/36.26% on MNIST/Fashion-MNIST dataset, respectively.",NO_AFFILIATIONS,"Sunghyun Choi, Dongwoo Lew, Jongsun Park, ",IEEE transactions on biomedical circuits and systems,NO_DATE,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35687615
268,Heterogeneous Ensemble-Based Spike-Driven Few-Shot Online Learning,"Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are regarded as a promising candidate to deal with the major challenges of current machine learning techniques, including the high energy consumption induced by deep neural networks. However, there is still a great gap between SNNs and the few-shot learning performance of artificial neural networks. Importantly, existing spike-based few-shot learning models do not target robust learning based on spatiotemporal dynamics and superior machine learning theory. In this paper, we propose a novel spike-based framework with the entropy theory, namely, heterogeneous ensemble-based spike-driven few-shot online learning (HESFOL). The proposed HESFOL model uses the entropy theory to establish the gradient-based few-shot learning scheme in a recurrent SNN architecture. We examine the performance of the HESFOL model based on the few-shot classification tasks using spiking patterns and the Omniglot data set, as well as the few-shot motor control task using an end-effector. Experimental results show that the proposed HESFOL scheme can effectively improve the accuracy and robustness of spike-driven few-shot learning performance. More importantly, the proposed HESFOL model emphasizes the application of modern entropy-based machine learning methods in state-of-the-art spike-driven learning algorithms. Therefore, our study provides new perspectives for further integration of advanced entropy theory in machine learning to improve the learning performance of SNNs, which could be of great merit to applied developments with spike-based neuromorphic systems.","['1 School of Electrical and Information Engineering, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China.', '2 Microelectronics Institute of Seville, Seville, Spain.', ""3 Institute of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China.""]","Shuangming Yang, Bernabe Linares-Barranco, Badong Chen, ",Frontiers in neuroscience,2022,brain-inspired intelligence; entropy-based learning; few-shot learning; spike-driven learning; spiking neural network.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35615277
269,Spatial Memory in a Spiking Neural Network with Robot Embodiment,"Cognitive maps and spatial memory are fundamental paradigms of brain functioning. Here, we present a spiking neural network (SNN) capable of generating an internal representation of the external environment and implementing spatial memory. The SNN initially has a non-specific architecture, which is then shaped by Hebbian-type synaptic plasticity. The network receives stimuli at specific loci, while the memory retrieval operates as a functional SNN response in the form of population bursts. The SNN function is explored through its embodiment in a robot moving in an arena with safe and dangerous zones. We propose a measure of the global network memory using the synaptic vector field approach to validate results and calculate information characteristics, including learning curves. We show that after training, the SNN can effectively control the robot's cognitive behavior, allowing it to avoid dangerous regions in the arena. However, the learning is not perfect. The robot eventually visits dangerous areas. Such behavior, also observed in animals, enables relearning in time-evolving environments. If a dangerous zone moves into another place, the SNN remaps positive and negative areas, allowing escaping the catastrophic interference phenomenon known for some AI architectures. Thus, the robot adapts to changing world.","['1 Neurotechnology Department, Lobachevsky State University of Nizhny Novgorod, 23 Gagarin Ave., 603950 Nizhny Novgorod, Russia.', '2 Neuroscience and Cognitive Technology Laboratory, Center for Technologies in Robotics and Mechatronics Components, Innopolis University, 1 Universitetskaya Str., 420500 Innopolis, Russia.', '3 Center For Neurotechnology and Machine Learning, Immanuel Kant Baltic Federal University, 14 Nevsky Str., 236016 Kaliningrad, Russia.', '4 Instituto de Matemática Interdisciplinar, Facultad de Ciencias Matemáticas, Universidad Complutense de Madrid, 28040 Madrid, Spain.', '5 Lab of Neurocybernetics, Russian State Scientific Center for Robotics and Technical Cybernetics, 21 Tikhoretsky Ave., St., 194064 Petersburg, Russia.']","Sergey A Lobov, Alexey I Zharinov, Valeri A Makarov, Victor B Kazantsev, ","Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2021,STDP; cognitive maps; learning; neurorobotics; spiking neural networks; vector field of functional connections; vector field of synaptic connections.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33920246
270,Energy-Efficient Respiratory Anomaly Detection in Premature Newborn Infants,"Precise monitoring of respiratory rate in premature newborn infants is essential to initiating medical interventions as required. Wired technologies can be invasive and obtrusive to the patients. We propose a deep-learning-enabled wearable monitoring system for premature newborn infants, where respiratory cessation is predicted using signals that are collected wirelessly from a non-invasive wearable Bellypatch put on the infant's body. We propose a five-stage design pipeline involving data collection and labeling, feature scaling, deep learning model selection with hyperparameter tuning, model training and validation, and model testing and deployment. The model used is a 1-D convolutional neural network (1DCNN) architecture with one convolution layer, one pooling layer, and three fully-connected layers, achieving 97.15% classification accuracy. To address the energy limitations of wearable processing, several quantization techniques are explored, and their performance and energy consumption are analyzed for the respiratory classification task. Results demonstrate a reduction of energy footprints and model storage overhead with a considerable degradation of the classification accuracy, meaning that quantization and other model compression techniques are not the best solution for respiratory classification problem on wearable devices. To improve accuracy while reducing the energy consumption, we propose a novel spiking neural network (SNN)-based respiratory classification solution, which can be implemented on event-driven neuromorphic hardware platforms. To this end, we propose an approach to convert the analog operations of our baseline trained 1DCNN to their spiking equivalent. We perform a design-space exploration using the parameters of the converted SNN to generate inference solutions having different accuracy and energy footprints. We select a solution that achieves an accuracy of 93.33% with 18× lower energy compared to the baseline 1DCNN model. Additionally, the proposed SNN solution achieves similar accuracy as the quantized model with a 4× lower energy.","['1 Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Drexel University College of Engineering, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.', '2 Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, Ursinus College, Collegeville, PA 19426, USA.']","Ankita Paul, Md Abu Saleh Tajin, Anup Das, William M Mongan, Kapil R Dandekar, ",Electronics,NO_DATE,deep learning; respiratory classification; spiking neural network (SNN); wearable.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36199762
271,Spiking Neural Network (SNN) With Memristor Synapses Having Non-linear Weight Update,"Among many artificial neural networks, the research on Spike Neural Network (SNN), which mimics the energy-efficient signal system in the brain, is drawing much attention. Memristor is a promising candidate as a synaptic component for hardware implementation of SNN, but several non-ideal device properties are making it challengeable. In this work, we conducted an SNN simulation by adding a device model with a non-linear weight update to test the impact on SNN performance. We found that SNN has a strong tolerance for the device non-linearity and the network can keep the accuracy high if a device meets one of the two conditions: 1. symmetric LTP and LTD curves and 2. positive non-linearity factors for both LTP and LTD. The reason was analyzed in terms of the balance between network parameters as well as the variability of weight. The results are considered to be a piece of useful prior information for the future implementation of emerging device-based neuromorphic hardware.","['1 Center for Neuromorphic Engineering, Korea Institutes of Science and Technology, Seoul, South Korea.']","Taeyoon Kim, Suman Hu, Jaewook Kim, Joon Young Kwak, Jongkil Park, Suyoun Lee, Inho Kim, Jong-Keuk Park, YeonJoo Jeong, ",Frontiers in computational neuroscience,2021,LTP/LTD ratio; homeostasis; memristor; non-linearity; spiking neural network.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33776676

If the patient is infected with COVID-19, a chest X-ray can be used to determine this. In this work, an X-ray showing a COVID-19 infection is classified by the capsule neural network model we trained to recognise. 6310 chest X-ray pictures were used to train the models, separated into three categories: normal, pneumonia, and COVID-19. This work is considered an improved deep learning model for the classification of COVID-19 disease through X-ray images. Viewpoint invariance, fewer parameters, and better generalisation are some of the advantages of CapsNet compared with the classic convolutional neural network (CNN) models. The proposed model has achieved an accuracy greater than 95% during the model's training, which is better than the other state-of-the-art algorithms.

274,STSC-SNN: Spatio-Temporal Synaptic Connection with temporal convolution and attention for spiking neural networks,"Spiking neural networks (SNNs), as one of the algorithmic models in neuromorphic computing, have gained a great deal of research attention owing to temporal information processing capability, low power consumption, and high biological plausibility. The potential to efficiently extract spatio-temporal features makes it suitable for processing event streams. However, existing synaptic structures in SNNs are almost full-connections or spatial 2D convolution, neither of which can extract temporal dependencies adequately. In this work, we take inspiration from biological synapses and propose a Spatio-Temporal Synaptic Connection SNN (STSC-SNN) model to enhance the spatio-temporal receptive fields of synaptic connections, thereby establishing temporal dependencies across layers. Specifically, we incorporate temporal convolution and attention mechanisms to implement synaptic filtering and gating functions. We show that endowing synaptic models with temporal dependencies can improve the performance of SNNs on classification tasks. In addition, we investigate the impact of performance via varied spatial-temporal receptive fields and reevaluate the temporal modules in SNNs. Our approach is tested on neuromorphic datasets, including DVS128 Gesture (gesture recognition), N-MNIST, CIFAR10-DVS (image classification), and SHD (speech digit recognition).

These systems can process spatio-temporal data in real time, and are highly energy efficient. In this study, we used a new hybrid event-based camera in conjunction with a multi-layer spiking neural network trained with a spike-timing-dependent plasticity learning rule. We showed that neurons learn from repeated and correlated spatio-temporal patterns in an unsupervised way and become selective to motion features, such as direction and speed. This motion selectivity can then be used to predict ball trajectory by adding a simple read-out layer composed of polynomial regressions, and trained in a supervised manner. Hence, we show that a SNN receiving inputs from an event-based sensor can extract relevant spatio-temporal patterns to process and predict ball trajectories.","['1 CERCO UMR 5549, CNRS-Université Toulouse 3, Toulouse, France.', '2 Laboratory for Research on Learning and Development (LEAD), University of Burgundy, CNRS UMR, Dijon, France.']","Guillaume Debat, Tushar Chauhan, Benoit R Cottereau, Timothée Masquelier, Michel Paindavoine, Robin Baures, ",Frontiers in computational neuroscience,2021,SNN; STDP; ball trajectory prediction; motion selectivity; spiking camera; unsupervised learning.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34108870
276,BCNet: A Novel Network for Blood Cell Classification,"Aims: Most blood diseases, such as chronic anemia, leukemia (commonly known as blood cancer), and hematopoietic dysfunction, are caused by environmental pollution, substandard decoration materials, radiation exposure, and long-term use certain drugs. Thus, it is imperative to classify the blood cell images. Most cell classification is based on the manual feature, machine learning classifier or the deep convolution network neural model. However, manual feature extraction is a very tedious process, and the results are usually unsatisfactory. On the other hand, the deep convolution neural network is usually composed of massive layers, and each layer has many parameters. Therefore, each deep convolution neural network needs a lot of time to get the results. Another problem is that medical data sets are relatively small, which may lead to overfitting problems. Methods: To address these problems, we propose seven models for the automatic classification of blood cells: BCARENet, BCR5RENet, BCMV2RENet, BCRRNet, BCRENet, BCRSNet, and BCNet. The BCNet model is the best model among the seven proposed models. The backbone model in our method is selected as the ResNet-18, which is pre-trained on the ImageNet set. To improve the performance of the proposed model, we replace the last four layers of the trained transferred ResNet-18 model with the three randomized neural networks (RNNs), which are RVFL, ELM, and SNN. The final outputs of our BCNet are generated by the ensemble of the predictions from the three randomized neural networks by the majority voting. We use four multi-classification indexes for the evaluation of our model. Results: The accuracy, average precision, average F1-score, and average recall are 96.78, 97.07, 96.78, and 96.77%, respectively.

277,Exploring Adversarial Attack in Spiking Neural Networks With Spike-Compatible Gradient,"Spiking neural network (SNN) is broadly deployed in neuromorphic devices to emulate brain function. In this context, SNN security becomes important while lacking in-depth investigation. To this end, we target the adversarial attack against SNNs and identify several challenges distinct from the artificial neural network (ANN) attack: 1) current adversarial attack is mainly based on gradient information that presents in a spatiotemporal pattern in SNNs, hard to obtain with conventional backpropagation algorithms; 2) the continuous gradient of the input is incompatible with the binary spiking input during gradient accumulation, hindering the generation of spike-based adversarial examples; and 3) the input gradient can be all-zeros (i.e., vanishing) sometimes due to the zero-dominant derivative of the firing function. Recently, backpropagation through time (BPTT)-inspired learning algorithms are widely introduced into SNNs to improve the performance, which brings the possibility to attack the models accurately given spatiotemporal gradient maps. We propose two approaches to address the above challenges of gradient-input incompatibility and gradient vanishing. Specifically, we design a gradient-to-spike (G2S) converter to convert continuous gradients to ternary ones compatible with spike inputs. Then, we design a restricted spike flipper (RSF) to construct ternary gradients that can randomly flip the spike inputs with a controllable turnover rate, when meeting all-zero gradients. Putting these methods together, we build an adversarial attack methodology for SNNs. Moreover, we analyze the influence of the training loss function and the firing threshold of the penultimate layer on the attack effectiveness.

278,DeepCap-Kcr: accurate identification and investigation of protein lysine crotonylation sites based on capsule network,"Lysine crotonylation (Kcr) is a posttranslational modification widely detected in histone and nonhistone proteins. It plays a vital role in human disease progression and various cellular processes, including cell cycle, cell organization, chromatin remodeling and a key mechanism to increase proteomic diversity. Thus, accurate information on such sites is beneficial for both drug development and basic research. Existing computational methods can be improved to more effectively identify Kcr sites in proteins. In this study, we proposed a deep learning model, DeepCap-Kcr, a capsule network (CapsNet) based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) for robust prediction of Kcr sites on histone and nonhistone proteins (mammals). The proposed model outperformed the existing CNN architecture Deep-Kcr and other well-established tools in most cases and provided promising outcomes for practical use; in particular, the proposed model characterized the internal hierarchical representation as well as the important features from multiple levels of abstraction automatically learned from a small number of samples. The trained model was well generalized in other species (papaya). Moreover, we showed the features and properties generated by the internal capsule layer that can explore the internal data distribution related to biological significance (as a motif detector).

279,Volumetric macromolecule identification in cryo-electron tomograms using capsule networks,"Background:
        
      
      Despite recent advances in cellular cryo-electron tomography (CET), developing automated tools for macromolecule identification in submolecular resolution remains challenging due to the lack of annotated data and high structural complexities. To date, the extent of the deep learning methods constructed for this problem is limited to conventional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Identifying macromolecules of different types and sizes is a tedious and time-consuming task. In this paper, we employ a capsule-based architecture to automate the task of macromolecule identification, that we refer to as 3D-UCaps. In particular, the architecture is composed of three components: feature extractor, capsule encoder, and CNN decoder. The feature extractor converts voxel intensities of input sub-tomograms to activities of local features. The encoder is a 3D Capsule Network (CapsNet) that takes local features to generate a low-dimensional representation of the input. Then, a 3D CNN decoder reconstructs the sub-tomograms from the given representation by upsampling. Results:
        
      
      We performed binary and multi-class localization and identification tasks on synthetic and experimental data. We observed that the 3D-UNet and the 3D-UCaps had an [Formula: see text]score mostly above 60% and 70%, respectively, on the test data. In both network architectures, we observed degradation of at least 40% in the [Formula: see text]-score when identifying very small particles (PDB entry 3GL1) compared to a large particle (PDB entry 4D8Q). In the multi-class identification task of experimental data, 3D-UCaps had an [Formula: see text]-score of 91% on the test data in contrast to 64% of the 3D-UNet. The better [Formula: see text]-score of 3D-UCaps compared to 3D-UNet is obtained by a higher precision score. We speculate this to be due to the capsule network employed in the encoder. To study the effect of the CapsNet-based encoder architecture further, we performed an ablation study and perceived that the [Formula: see text]-score is boosted as network depth is increased which is in contrast to the previously reported results for the 3D-UNet. To present a reproducible work, source code, trained models, data as well as visualization results are made publicly available. Conclusion:
        
      
      Quantitative and qualitative results show that 3D-UCaps successfully perform various downstream tasks including identification and localization of macromolecules and can at least compete with CNN architectures for this task. Given that the capsule layers extract both the existence probability and the orientation of the molecules, this architecture has the potential to lead to representations of the data that are better interpretable than those of 3D-UNet.","['1 Department of Visual and Data-Centric Computing, Zuse Institute Berlin, Takustraße 7, 14195, Berlin, Germany. hajarolasvadi@zib.de.', '2 Department of Visual and Data-Centric Computing, Zuse Institute Berlin, Takustraße 7, 14195, Berlin, Germany.', '3 Department of CryoEM Technology, Max Planck Institute of Biochemistry, Am Klopferspitz 18, 82152, Martinsried, Germany.', '4 Materials and Structural Analysis, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Takustraße 7, 14195, Berlin, Germany.']","Noushin Hajarolasvadi, Vikram Sunkara, Sagar Khavnekar, Florian Beck, Robert Brandt, Daniel Baum, ",BMC bioinformatics,2022,Biomedical imaging; Capsule network; Cellular cryo-electron tomography; Deep learning; Macromolecule identification.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36042418
280,Loop Closure Detection Based on Residual Network and Capsule Network for Mobile Robot,"Loop closure detection based on a residual network (ResNet) and a capsule network (CapsNet) is proposed to address the problems of low accuracy and poor robustness for mobile robot simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) in complex scenes. First, the residual network of a feature coding strategy is introduced to extract the shallow geometric features and deep semantic features of images, reduce the amount of image noise information, accelerate the convergence speed of the model, and solve the problems of gradient disappearance and network degradation of deep neural networks. Then, the dynamic routing mechanism of the capsule network is optimized through the entropy peak density, and a vector is used to represent the spatial position relationship between features, which can improve the ability of image feature extraction and expression to optimize the overall performance of networks. Finally, the optimized residual network and capsule network are fused to retain the differences and correlations between features, and the global feature descriptors and feature vectors are combined to calculate the similarity of image features for loop closure detection. The experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve loop closure detection for mobile robots in complex scenes, such as view changes, illumination changes, and dynamic objects, and improve the accuracy and robustness of mobile robot SLAM.","['1 School of Mechanical Engineering, Shenyang Ligong University, Shenyang 110159, China.', '2 Shenyang Institute of Computing Technology Co., Ltd., Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenyang 110168, China.', '3 Software College, Northeastern University, Shenyang 110169, China.']","Xin Zhang, Liaomo Zheng, Zhenhua Tan, Suo Li, ","Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2022,capsule network (CapsNet); loop closure detection; mobile robot; residual network (ResNet); simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM).,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36236235
281,Crop Yield Prediction Using Deep Neural Networks,"Crop yield is a highly complex trait determined by multiple factors such as genotype, environment, and their interactions. Accurate yield prediction requires fundamental understanding of the functional relationship between yield and these interactive factors, and to reveal such relationship requires both comprehensive datasets and powerful algorithms. In the 2018 Syngenta Crop Challenge, Syngenta released several large datasets that recorded the genotype and yield performances of 2,267 maize hybrids planted in 2,247 locations between 2008 and 2016 and asked participants to predict the yield performance in 2017. As one of the winning teams, we designed a deep neural network (DNN) approach that took advantage of state-of-the-art modeling and solution techniques. Our model was found to have a superior prediction accuracy, with a root-mean-square-error (RMSE) being 12% of the average yield and 50% of the standard deviation for the validation dataset using predicted weather data. With perfect weather data, the RMSE would be reduced to 11% of the average yield and 46% of the standard deviation. We also performed feature selection based on the trained DNN model, which successfully decreased the dimension of the input space without significant drop in the prediction accuracy. Our computational results suggested that this model significantly outperformed other popular methods such as Lasso, shallow neural networks (SNN), and regression tree (RT). The results also revealed that environmental factors had a greater effect on the crop yield than genotype.","['1 Industrial and Manufacturing Systems Engineering, Iowa State University, Ames, IA, United States.']","Saeed Khaki, Lizhi Wang, ",Frontiers in plant science,2019,deep learning; feature selection; machine learning; weather prediction; yield prediction.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31191564
282,ROENet: A ResNet-Based Output Ensemble for Malaria Parasite Classification,"Background:
        
      
      (1)People may be infected with an insect-borne disease (malaria) through the blood input of malaria-infected people or the bite of Anopheles mosquitoes. Doctors need a lot of time and energy to diagnose malaria, and sometimes the results are not ideal. Many researchers use CNN to classify malaria images. However, we believe that the classification performance of malaria parasites can be improved. Methods:
        
      
      (2)In this paper, we propose a novel method (ROENet) to automatically classify malaria parasite on the blood smear. The backbone of ROENet is the pretrained ResNet-18. We use randomized neural networks (RNNs) as the classifier in our proposed model. Three RNNs are used in ROENet, which are random vector functional link (RVFL), Schmidt neural network (SNN), and extreme learning machine (ELM). To improve the performance of ROENet, the results of ROENet are the ensemble outputs from three RNNs. Results:

283,Neuronal-Plasticity and Reward-Propagation Improved Recurrent Spiking Neural Networks,"Different types of dynamics and plasticity principles found through natural neural networks have been well-applied on Spiking neural networks (SNNs) because of their biologically-plausible efficient and robust computations compared to their counterpart deep neural networks (DNNs). Here, we further propose a special Neuronal-plasticity and Reward-propagation improved Recurrent SNN (NRR-SNN). The historically-related adaptive threshold with two channels is highlighted as important neuronal plasticity for increasing the neuronal dynamics, and then global labels instead of errors are used as a reward for the paralleling gradient propagation. Besides, a recurrent loop with proper sparseness is designed for robust computation. Higher accuracy and stronger robust computation are achieved on two sequential datasets (i.e., TIDigits and TIMIT datasets), which to some extent, shows the power of the proposed NRR-SNN with biologically-plausible improvements.","['1 Research Center for Brain-Inspired Intelligence, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CASIA), Beijing, China.', '2 School of Artificial Intelligence, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS), Beijing, China.', '3 Faculty of Information Technology, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing, China.', '4 Center for Excellence in Brain Science and Intelligence Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China.']","Shuncheng Jia, Tielin Zhang, Xiang Cheng, Hongxing Liu, Bo Xu, ",Frontiers in neuroscience,2021,neuronal plasticity; reward propagation; sparse connections; spiking neural network; synaptic plasticity.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33776644
284,Event Camera Simulator Improvements via Characterized Parameters,"It has been more than two decades since the first neuromorphic Dynamic Vision Sensor (DVS) sensor was invented, and many subsequent prototypes have been built with a wide spectrum of applications in mind. Competing against state-of-the-art neural networks in terms of accuracy is difficult, although there are clear opportunities to outperform conventional approaches in terms of power consumption and processing speed. As neuromorphic sensors generate sparse data at the focal plane itself, they are inherently energy-efficient, data-driven, and fast. In this work, we present an extended DVS pixel simulator for neuromorphic benchmarks which simplifies the latency and the noise models. In addition, to more closely model the behaviour of a real pixel, the readout circuitry is modelled, as this can strongly affect the time precision of events in complex scenes. Using a dynamic variant of the MNIST dataset as a benchmarking task, we use this simulator to explore how the latency of the sensor allows it to outperform conventional sensors in terms of sensing speed.","['1 International Centre for Neuromorphic Systems, The MARCS Institute for Brain, Behaviour, and Development, Western Sydney University, Kingswood, NSW, Australia.']","Damien Joubert, Alexandre Marcireau, Nic Ralph, Andrew Jolley, André van Schaik, Gregory Cohen, ",Frontiers in neuroscience,2021,SNN algorithm; SNN benchmarks; event cameras; event-based algorithms; simulator.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34385903
285,Optimal Deep-Learning-Enabled Intelligent Decision Support System for SARS-CoV-2 Classification,"Intelligent decision support systems (IDSS) for complex healthcare applications aim to examine a large quantity of complex healthcare data to assist doctors, researchers, pathologists, and other healthcare professionals. A decision support system (DSS) is an intelligent system that provides improved assistance in various stages of health-related disease diagnosis. At the same time, the SARS-CoV-2 infection that causes COVID-19 disease has spread globally from the beginning of 2020. Several research works reported that the imaging pattern based on computed tomography (CT) can be utilized to detect SARS-CoV-2. Earlier identification and detection of the diseases is essential to offer adequate treatment and avoid the severity of the disease. With this motivation, this study develops an efficient deep-learning-based fusion model with swarm intelligence (EDLFM-SI) for SARS-CoV-2 identification. The proposed EDLFM-SI technique aims to detect and classify the SARS-CoV-2 infection or not. Also, the EDLFM-SI technique comprises various processes, namely, data augmentation, preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification. Moreover, a fusion of capsule network (CapsNet) and MobileNet based feature extractors are employed. Besides, a water strider algorithm (WSA) is applied to fine-tune the hyperparameters involved in the DL models. Finally, a cascaded neural network (CNN) classifier is applied for detecting the existence of SARS-CoV-2. In order to showcase the improved performance of the EDLFM-SI technique, a wide range of simulations take place on the COVID-19 CT data set and the SARS-CoV-2 CT scan data set. The simulation outcomes highlighted the supremacy of the EDLFM-SI technique over the recent approaches.","['1 Department of Computer Science and Information Systems, College of Applied Sciences, AlMaarefa University, Ad Diriyah Riyadh 13713, Saudi Arabia.', '2 Department of Business Administration, AlMajmaah University, Saudi Arabia.', '3 AlMaarefa University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', '4 Department of Information Technology, Kongu Engineering College, Erode 638060, India.', '5 Department of Computer Science and Engineering, K.

286,Real-time cortical simulation on neuromorphic hardware,"Real-time simulation of a large-scale biologically representative spiking neural network is presented, through the use of a heterogeneous parallelization scheme and SpiNNaker neuromorphic hardware. A published cortical microcircuit model is used as a benchmark test case, representing ≈1 mm2 of early sensory cortex, containing 77 k neurons and 0.3 billion synapses. This is the first hard real-time simulation of this model, with 10 s of biological simulation time executed in 10 s wall-clock time. This surpasses best-published efforts on HPC neural simulators (3 × slowdown) and GPUs running optimized spiking neural network (SNN) libraries (2 × slowdown). Furthermore, the presented approach indicates that real-time processing can be maintained with increasing SNN size, breaking the communication barrier incurred by traditional computing machinery. Model results are compared to an established HPC simulator baseline to verify simulation correctness, comparing well across a range of statistical measures. Energy to solution and energy per synaptic event are also reported, demonstrating that the relatively low-tech SpiNNaker processors achieve a 10 × reduction in energy relative to modern HPC systems, and comparable energy consumption to modern GPUs. Finally, system robustness is demonstrated through multiple 12 h simulations of the cortical microcircuit, each simulating 12 h of biological time, and demonstrating the potential of neuromorphic hardware as a neuroscience research tool for studying complex spiking neural networks over extended time periods.

287,Hierarchical One-Class Model With Subnetwork for Representation Learning and Outlier Detection,"The multilayer one-class classification (OCC) frameworks have gained great traction in research on anomaly and outlier detection. However, most multilayer OCC algorithms suffer from loosely connected feature coding, affecting the ability of generated latent space to properly generate a highly discriminative representation between object classes. To alleviate this deficiency, two novel OCC frameworks, namely: 1) OCC structure using the subnetwork neural network (OC-SNN) and 2) maximum correntropy-based OC-SNN (MCOC-SNN), are proposed in this article. The novelties of this article are as follows: 1) the subnetwork is used to build the discriminative latent space; 2) the proposed models are one-step learning networks, instead of stacking feature learning blocks and final classification layer to recognize the input pattern; 3) unlike existing works which utilize mean square error (MSE) to learn low-dimensional features, the MCOC-SNN uses maximum correntropy criterion (MCC) for discriminative feature encoding; and 4) a brand-new OCC dataset, called CO-Mask, is built for this research. Experimental results on the visual classification domain with a varying number of training samples from 6131 to 513,061 demonstrate that the proposed OC-SNN and MCOC-SNN achieve superior performance compared to the existing multilayer OCC models.

This paper proposes a shallow architecture based on Capsule Networks with convolutional layers to detect COVID-19 infected persons. The proposed method combines the ability of the capsule network to understand spatial information with convolutional layers for efficient feature extraction. Due to the model's shallow architecture, it has 23M parameters to train and requires fewer training samples. The proposed system is fast and robust and correctly classifies the X-Ray images into three classes, i.e. COVID-19, No Findings, and Viral Pneumonia. Experimental results on the X-Ray dataset show that our model performs well despite having fewer samples for the training and achieved an average accuracy of 96.47% for multi-class and 97.69% for binary classification on 5-fold cross-validation.

However, the rising number of transmitters and receivers for obtaining a higher angular resolution increases the cost for digital signal processing. One promising approach for energy-efficient signal processing is the usage of brain-inspired spiking neural networks (SNNs) implemented on neuromorphic hardware. In this article we perform a step-by-step analysis of automotive radar processing and argue how spiking neural networks could replace or complement the conventional processing. We provide SNN examples for two processing steps and evaluate their accuracy and computational efficiency. For radar target detection, an SNN with temporal coding is competitive to the conventional approach at a low compute overhead. Instead, our SNN for target classification achieves an accuracy close to a reference artificial neural network while requiring 200 times less operations. Finally, we discuss the specific requirements and challenges for SNN-based radar processing on neuromorphic hardware. This study proves the general applicability of SNNs for automotive radar processing and sustains the prospect of energy-efficient realizations in automated vehicles.","['1 Chair of Highly-Parallel VLSI-Systems and Neuro-Microelectronics, Faculty of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Institute of Principles of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Technische Universität Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', '2 Infineon Technologies Dresden GmbH & Co., KG, Dresden, Germany.', '3 Department of Informatics, Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany.', '4 Infineon Technologies AG, Munich, Germany.', '5 BMW Group, Research, New Technologies, Garching, Germany.', '6 Centre for Tactile Internet (CeTI) With Human-In-The-Loop, Cluster of Excellence, Technische Universität Dresden, Dresden, Germany.']","Bernhard Vogginger, Felix Kreutz, Javier López-Randulfe, Chen Liu, Robin Dietrich, Hector A Gonzalez, Daniel Scholz, Nico Reeb, Daniel Auge, Julian Hille, Muhammad Arsalan, Florian Mirus, Cyprian Grassmann, Alois Knoll, Christian Mayr, ",Frontiers in neuroscience,2022,FMCW; MIMO; automotive; neuromorphic computing; radar processing; signal processing; spiking neural networks.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35431782
